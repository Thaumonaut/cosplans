## **II. Zero-Budget Organic Growth Strategy**

1. **Value-First Marketing:** Focus on the \\mathbf{0\\%} commission and the **Reputation System** as the core value proposition in all content marketing.  
2. **Influencer Trade:** Offer the $12/mo **Pro Premium** tier free to 5-10 key creative influencers in exchange for organic reviews and tutorials.  
3. **Community Gating:** Use the app's internal data (Reputation, Project Success) to generate shareable content that drives organic traffic and sign-ups.

## **III. Viability Check**

This project is viable for a solo developer due to the efficient stack and the Spec-Driven workflow, provided the founder maintains **relentless scope control** and manages context switching across developer, marketing, and business roles. **Avoid hiring or seeking investment until V1.0 revenue is proven.**
