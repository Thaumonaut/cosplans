# Cosplay Planning App - Feature Specification Summary

## Core Architecture
- **Stack**: SvelteKit, Supabase (backend), Bun, Vite
- **Target Market**: USA/English-speaking initially, future expansion to Japan/Korea
- **User Base**: Beginner to experienced cosplayers, photographers, commissioners

## Team System

### Team Structure
Every user has a **personal team** (their workspace) created automatically on signup:
- Cannot be deleted (only archived)
- User is sole owner
- Acts as portfolio
- Can be renamed by user

Users can create/join **collaborative teams**:
- Free tier: Personal team + join 1 collaborative team
- Premium: Personal team + create 3, join 5 collaborative teams
- Team Premium: Purchase premium for specific team (up to 15 members benefit)

### Team Types
1. **Personal Team**: Individual workspace, portfolio, solo projects
2. **Collaborative Teams**: Small groups (2-10 people) for group cosplays, creator collectives, convention squads
3. **Temp/Event Teams**: Short-lived teams for specific photoshoots
   - Set expiration date (auto-archive after event)
   - Public discovery board
   - Free to create for all tiers
   - Auto-archive 7 days after event
   - Optional conversion to permanent team

### Temp Team Features
- **Discovery**: Search by fandom, location, date, skill level
- **Requirements**: Character needs, max participants, skill requirements
- **Visibility**: Public listing, unlisted (link only), or private
- **Safety**: Account age display, past event ratings, report system
- **Post-Event**: Photo gallery, "work with again" easy re-invite

## Reputation System

### Simplified Tier-Based System (No numerical scores)

**Tiers** (from best to worst):
1. **üåü Exemplary**: 20+ events, 95%+ on-time, 0 no-shows/year, 4.5+ avg rating
2. **‚úÖ Reliable**: 10+ events, 85%+ on-time, 0 no-shows/year, 4.0+ avg rating
3. **üëç Consistent**: 5+ events, 75%+ on-time, max 1 no-show/year, 3.5+ avg rating
4. **üÜï Building Reputation**: New users or <5 events (default starting tier)
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è Flaky**: <70% on-time, 2+ no-shows/year, 3+ late cancellations
6. **üö´ Unreliable**: <50% on-time, 3+ no-shows/year (restricted from events)

### Reputation Calculation
- Based on last 12 months of data only
- Metrics: events attended, on-time rate, no-shows, cancellation timing, avg rating
- Recalculated after each event
- Users can improve by completing events successfully

### Event Restrictions by Tier
- **Exemplary/Reliable/Consistent**: Can join all events, auto-approved
- **Building**: Can join most events (organizer can restrict), auto-approved
- **Flaky**: Limited access, requires manual organizer approval
- **Unreliable**: Temporary ban from public events (30-90 days), very limited access

### Reputation Building
- Any user can host events (helps build reputation)
- Clear progression path shown in profile
- Tips for improvement
- Warnings before tier drops
- Positive actions rewarded (streaks, badges)

### Notifications
- Warning when about to drop tier: "One more no-show will move you to Flaky status"
- Tips for improvement shown in profile
- Clear path to next tier with specific requirements

## Event Attendance System

### Custom Leave-By Date & Severity
**Organizers set**:
- Custom leave-by date (default: 72 hours before event)
- Cancellation severity level:
  - **Lenient**: Minor penalties (community meetups)
  - **Standard**: Normal penalties (typical shoots)
  - **Strict**: Significant penalties (organized productions)
  - **Critical**: Severe penalties (group cosplays where all members essential)

### Cancellation Penalties (Standard severity example)
- 72+ hours notice: 0 penalty
- 24-72 hours notice: -2 impact
- <24 hours notice: -5 impact
- No-show: -10 impact

Severity multiplies these impacts. Critical events may trigger temporary suspensions for no-shows.

### Attendance Tracking
```sql
event_attendance {
  user_id,
  event_id,
  status: 'confirmed' | 'attended' | 'no_show' | 'cancelled_advance' | 'cancelled_late',
  confirmed_at,
  cancelled_at,
  notice_period_hours,
  attended_verified_by, // organizer confirms
  rating_received
}
```

### Post-Event Ratings

- Optional public comments
- Displayed on user profiles
- Contributes to reputation tier calculation

## Public Profiles & Portfolios

## Notes for AI-Assisted Development

### Context for AI Pair Programming
When working with AI assistants on this codebase:

1. **Always specify**: SvelteKit + Supabase + TypeScript
2. **Mention tier**: Which subscription tier the feature applies to
3. **State dependencies**: What integrations/APIs the feature uses
4. **Reference reputation**: How features interact with reputation system
5. **Consider teams**: Personal vs collaborative vs temp team context

### Common Patterns to Establish
- RLS policy patterns for different team types
- Reputation calculation triggers
- Event lifecycle hooks (created ‚Üí active ‚Üí completed ‚Üí archived)
- Export package generation flow
- Storage tier migrations (hot ‚Üí cold)

### Testing Priorities
- Reputation tier calculations
- Event eligibility checks
- Team access permissions
- Archive/restore flows
- Payment flows (Stripe integration)
- AI credit management

### Documentation Needs
- API integration guides for each service
- RLS policy documentation
- Reputation system logic
- Team lifecycle state machine
- Archive timeline flowchart
