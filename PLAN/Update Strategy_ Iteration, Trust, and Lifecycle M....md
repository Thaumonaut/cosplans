# **üîÅ Update Strategy: Iteration, Trust, and Lifecycle Management**

## **I. Community-Driven Feedback Loops**

Updates will be prioritized based on actionable data:

1. **Reputation Data:** Track **Reputation Grace** usage rate. High usage requires system adjustment.  
2. **Conversion Data:** Monitor the Free \\rightarrow **Growth Premium ($5/mo)** conversion rate. If low, adjust the **Active Project Limit** or enhance the value of the $5 tier.  
3. **GMV Analysis:** Track Gross Merchandise Volume generated through the Marketplace. Prioritize bug fixes and enhancements to the commission workflow to reduce friction and increase GMV.  
4. **Provider Suite Feedback:** Collect direct feedback on the **XMP Metadata Sync** feature. If users request automation for final delivery, prioritize development of the **Pro Premium Client Gallery (P6)**.

## **II. Feature Lifecycle Management**

| Feature State | Action / Maintenance |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Core (Auth, RLS)** | High priority security and performance updates. **Zero tolerance for security vulnerabilities.** |
| **Monetization (Stripe)** | Quarterly audit of Stripe webhooks. Ensure timely processing of commission payouts. |
| **AI Features** | **Constant Optimization:** Every 3-6 months, evaluate if a newer, smaller, or less expensive model can perform an existing AI task. **Prioritize cost reduction over new AI features.** |
| **Archived Data** | Verify the cold storage migration process monthly. Ensure the "Permanent Portfolio" (Personal Team Archive) is functioning for user retention. |
| **Integration** | Only integrate new high-effort APIs (e.g., Discord Bot, Notion Sync) when their usage is gated by a **paying tier** or when the community heavily requests them. |
