I am creating a cosplay planning app. I want some help brainstorming. I want to make something that will work for planning and tracking cosplay costumes (creating, editing, wig making/styling, part replacing) as well as prop making, photoshoot, photo editing, and social media post planning



## Response:

This is a great project idea! The cosplay creation process has so many moving parts, and a dedicated planning app could really help cosplayers stay organized. Let me help you think through this.

**Core Features to Consider:**

**Costume Management**
- Individual costume projects with progress tracking (planning → in progress → completed)
- Component breakdown (wig, makeup, fabric pieces, armor, accessories, etc.)
- Material lists with quantities, costs, and purchase tracking
- Reference image galleries for each component
- Tutorial/pattern links storage
- Size measurements and fitting notes

**Task & Timeline System**
- Milestone-based timelines (especially useful when targeting specific convention dates)
- Task dependencies (can't style wig until it arrives, can't assemble costume until pieces are sewn)
- Time estimates vs actual time spent
- Skill level indicators for different tasks

**Prop Tracking**
- Separate prop projects that can link to costumes
- Material and tool requirements
- Safety equipment reminders for certain techniques
- WIP photo documentation

**Photography & Post-Production Pipeline**
- Photoshoot planning (location scouting, photographer contact, shot list)
- Raw photo organization linked to specific costumes
- Editing checklist and status tracking
- Export settings/presets for different platforms

**Social Media Planning**
- Content calendar
- Platform-specific post drafts
- Hashtag collections
- Engagement tracking (optional)
- Credit tracking for photographers, fellow cosplayers, locations

**Budget Management**
- Per-project budgets
- Expense tracking by category
- Reusable materials inventory

**Questions to help refine the concept:**

What's your target user - beginners, experienced cosplayers, or both? This affects complexity and onboarding.

Are you thinking mobile-first, desktop, or cross-platform? Cosplayers often shop on mobile but craft at workstations.

Would you want community features (sharing projects, finding collaborators) or keep it personal productivity-focused?

What's the biggest pain point you're trying to solve from your own experience or research?



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 3:38:11 AM

I want to make something for beginner and experienced. I want community features and a way to commission others for different projects. I am planning web based first and then mobile apps later. I want to solve project overload when you have many ideas and need to organize them so you can get them done and reduce stress



## Response:
10/21/2025, 3:38:38 AM

Excellent! Tackling project overload is such a real problem in the cosplay community. Let me help you think through a structure that balances ambition with actual completion.

**Project Organization System**

**Idea Vault vs Active Projects**
- **Idea Bank**: Unlimited storage for "someday" costumes with minimal details (just images, character name, rough notes)
- **Active Queue**: Limited slots (maybe 3-5?) to force prioritization and prevent overwhelm
- **Archived/Completed**: Finished projects with full photo galleries and stats

**Prioritization Framework**
- Urgency filters (upcoming con dates, seasonal relevance)
- Complexity ratings (beginner-friendly vs advanced builds)
- Budget brackets
- Time estimates (weekend project vs 6-month build)
- "Quick win" tags for morale boosters between big projects

**Breaking Down Overwhelm**

**Smart Task Generation**
- When creating a project, the app could suggest common tasks based on costume type (armor build, fabric costume, closet cosplay, etc.)
- "Next action" highlighting - what's the literal next thing you can do right now?
- "5-minute tasks" filter for when you have tiny pockets of time

**Progress Visualization**
- Overall completion percentage
- Visual progress bars for major components
- Streak tracking for consistent work
- Before/after photo comparisons

**Community & Commission Features**

**Collaboration Hub**
- Find commissioners by specialty (wig styling, armor crafting, sewing, 3D printing, prop making)
- Portfolio browsing with ratings/reviews
- Built-in project proposals and quotes
- Commission status tracking (requested → quoted → in progress → completed)
- Escrow or milestone payment suggestions

**Community Inspiration**
- Project showcases (opt-in sharing)
- Time/budget breakdowns other users share
- "I made this too!" connections for the same character
- Skill-sharing (experienced crafters offering advice)
- Material swap/sale boards

**Accountability Features**
- Optional progress check-ins
- Accountability partners or crafting groups
- Convention countdown timers
- "Realistic timeline" calculator based on hours available per week

**Stress Reduction Features**

**Gentle Reminders**
- "You haven't worked on this in a week - want to schedule 30 minutes?"
- Suggested break points to prevent burnout
- Convention prep checklists (don't forget repair kit, makeup, shoes!)

**Flexibility Built-In**
- Easy project pausing without guilt
- "Scope creep" warnings when adding too many extras
- Permission to simplify (save complex version for later)
- Budget alerts before overspending causes stress

**Decision Helpers**
- "Which project should I start next?" quiz based on time/budget/skill/deadline
- Pros/cons comparison for costume variations
- Material substitution suggestions

**Technical Considerations for Your Vision:**

Since you're targeting both beginners and experienced users, you might want:
- **Onboarding paths**: Beginners get tutorials and templates, experienced users can skip to advanced features
- **Customization levels**: Simple mode vs power-user mode
- **Template library**: Pre-built project structures for common costume types
- **Progressive disclosure**: Don't overwhelm with every feature at once

**Potential Monetization** (if relevant):
- Free tier: Limited active projects, basic features
- Premium: Unlimited active projects, advanced analytics, commission marketplace access
- Commission fees: Small percentage on marketplace transactions

**What would make this stand out:**
The combination of "idea capture" (so nothing gets lost) with "forced prioritization" (so things actually get done) is powerful. Most productivity apps do one or the other, not both.

**Questions to dig deeper:**

Would you want AI features? (Suggesting materials, estimating costs, generating task lists from reference photos)

How would you handle the commission escrow/payment side? Or would you keep it as a connection platform only with external payment?

What's your vision for photo storage - unlimited or tiered?

Should there be convention/event discovery features to help people set deadlines?



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 3:45:54 AM

I do want ai features to help generate pose ideas, photoshoot backgrounds or locations, and other useful tools. I’m coming in with a photographer perspective so I’m wanting to think outside what I think would be useful. I would want to use a trusted third party system for managing payments. Also having tools to create contracts would be helpful. I think photo storage should be tiered with options to link with external sources for hosting. I do want a convention discovery and local events share with a tool for planning conventions days



## Response:
10/21/2025, 3:46:36 AM

Perfect! Your photographer perspective is actually a huge asset because photo planning is often the *most* overlooked part of cosplay projects. Let me expand on these ideas:

**Some Questions:**

For the AI features - are you thinking of building custom models or integrating existing APIs (like Stable Diffusion for backgrounds, GPT for suggestions)?

Would you want video storage too? (Behind-the-scenes, TikTok content, reels)

Should there be a rating/review system for both commissioners AND clients? (To protect both sides)

How would you handle international users for conventions and payments?

Would you want integration with social media for direct posting, or just planning/drafting?



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 3:55:38 AM

I would want to use off the shelf ai for now since this is a solo dev project with ai programming assistance. Video storage would be good. I also want to integrate a few services like Google Docs for generating docs from planning details, Pinterest for mood boards, notion for note taking, in app messaging with another api, instagram/tiktok for reels and post references and trending audio to plan reels, and more. Ratings/reviews should be two way. I want to focus on USA first or at least English speaking with plans for east Asia like Japan and Korea later. Integrations would be nice with the ability to queue a post to release at a certain time



## Response:
10/21/2025, 3:56:30 AM

**Convention Databases:**
- Comiket, AnimeJapan, Wonder Festival (Japan)
- Comic World, AFA Korea (South Korea)

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Different photo etiquette (posing styles, editing expectations)
- Privacy preferences may differ
- Commission culture variations

**Questions to Refine:**

What's your tech stack? (This affects integration choices - Next.js, React, etc.)

For the solo dev path - which integration would give you the MOST value for LEAST implementation complexity first?

Would you want white-label options for photographers to use your platform with their branding?

Should there be portfolio website generation (like Linktree but for cosplayers)?

Any interest in AR features eventually? (Virtual costume try-on, prop visualization)

**Questions to Refine Team Features:**

Should teams have their own billing/subscription tier separate from individual users?

Would you want team-wide analytics (productivity, spending, completion rates)?

Should there be team portfolio pages (public showcase of all team work)?

How many teams should one user be able to join? Unlimited or capped?

Should teams be able to have sub-teams? (Studio with multiple departments)

Would you want integration with Discord for team communication as an alternative to in-app messaging?

What about team-specific AI features? (Generate group shot composition suggestions, auto-assign tasks based on skills)



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 4:10:33 AM

I plan on every user being in a team which is either their personal team that only they are in or a public team they were invited into or created. I have not thought about open teams than anyone can join though. But i think any type of team would be able to add premium features. I think I want to focus on personal portfolios and smaller team. So idk about supporting large studios with internal teams since they seem a bit out of scope for this type of tool but maybe down the road if there is enough need. Discord integration could be good. And I think the amount of teams you can join could be a premium feature



## Response:
10/21/2025, 4:11:36 AM

Ah, that's a much cleaner model! So everyone starts with their own personal team (essentially their workspace), and can create/join additional teams. That simplifies things significantly and creates natural upsell opportunities. Let me rework the team concept with this structure:

**Team Structure Model**

**Personal Team (Default - Everyone gets one)**
- Created automatically on signup
- User is the sole owner
- All personal projects live here
- Can't leave or delete (it's your workspace)
- Acts as your portfolio
- Free tier: Limited projects, storage, features
- Premium: Unlocked features apply here

**Collaborative Teams**
- User creates or gets invited
- Shared workspace for group projects
- Team limit based on tier:
  - **Free**: 1 personal team only (or maybe +1 collaborative team)
  - **Premium Individual**: Personal + 3-5 collaborative teams
  - **Premium Team**: Personal + unlimited teams, OR team-wide premium features

**Team Premium Model Ideas:**

**Option 1: Individual Premium (User-based)**
- User pays → gets premium features everywhere they participate
- Their personal team is premium
- They bring premium features to any team they join
- Other team members see basic unless they're also premium

**Option 2: Team Premium (Team-based)**
- Team owner pays → entire team gets premium features for that team
- Useful for small groups that want to share costs
- Members' personal teams remain free unless they upgrade separately

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Personal premium for your own workspace
- Optional team premium upgrade for collaborative teams
- Owner pays, everyone benefits in that team

**Refined Team Types:**

**Personal Team (Solo)**
- Your portfolio and workspace
- All your individual projects
- Your commission history
- Your photo library
- Your social media planning
- Can share read-only with others (portfolio view)

**Duo/Pair Team (2 people)**
- Common for: Cosplayer + Photographer partnerships
- Shared photoshoot planning
- Joint content calendar
- Credit management
- Split costs tracking

**Small Group Team (3-10 people)**
- Friend groups doing group cosplays
- Convention squads
- Small creator collectives
- Shared resources and planning
- Group photoshoots

**Open/Public Teams** (Future consideration)
- Anyone can join (good for local communities)
- Location-based (NYC Cosplayers, LA Photoshoot Group)
- Character-specific (All Genshin Cosplayers)
- Event bulletin board
- Casual collaboration
- Maybe view-only for free users, participation requires premium?

**Premium Feature Tiers:**

**Free Tier:**
- 1 personal team
- 3 active projects
- 5GB photo storage
- Basic AI features (limited calls/month)
- 1 collaborative team membership
- Basic social scheduling (5 scheduled posts)
- Standard contracts

**Premium Individual ($9-15/month):**
- 1 personal team (premium features)
- Unlimited active projects in personal team
- 50GB photo storage
- Unlimited AI features
- Join up to 5 collaborative teams
- Advanced social scheduling (unlimited)
- Custom contract templates
- Notion/Pinterest/Google Docs integration
- Priority support
- Video storage (10GB)

**Premium Team ($25-40/month):**
- Team owner pays
- Entire team (up to 10 members) gets premium features in that team
- Shared 200GB storage pool
- Team analytics dashboard
- Advanced collaboration tools
- Shared AI quota (higher limit)
- Team templates and workflows
- Multiple commission pipelines

**Studio/Pro Tier** ($75-100/month - Future)
- For small businesses/professional commissioners
- Multiple teams management
- Client CRM features
- Advanced analytics
- White-label options
- API access
- Custom integrations

**Team Limit as Premium Feature:**

```
Free:
- Personal team
- Join 1 collaborative team

Premium ($12/month):
- Personal team (premium)
- Create up to 3 collaborative teams
- Join up to 5 collaborative teams
- Bring premium features to any team you're in

Team Premium ($30/month):
- Purchase for a specific team
- All members (up to 10) get premium in that team
- Doesn't affect member limits or personal teams
```

**Discord Integration Ideas:**

**Webhook Notifications:**
- New task assigned → Discord notification
- Project milestone reached
- Commission status updates
- Photoshoot reminders
- Convention countdown alerts
- Team member completed task

**Bot Commands:**
- `/cosplan tasks` - Show your upcoming tasks
- `/cosplan schedule` - Next week's conventions
- `/cosplan team @username` - Invite to team
- `/cosplan progress [project]` - Check project status

**Two-Way Sync:**
- Create tasks from Discord
- Update status via reactions
- Discussion threads linked to projects
- Photo sharing (auto-upload to project)

**Server Integration:**
- Link team to Discord server
- Auto-create channels for projects
- Role sync (team roles → Discord roles)
- Member verification

**Smart Team Features for Small Teams:**

**Automatic Role Detection:**
When someone joins a team, analyze their profile:
- Past projects (cosplayer, photographer, prop maker?)
- Skills listed
- Suggest appropriate permissions
- Auto-assign to relevant tasks

**Team Matching:**
- "Looking for photographer" in your area
- Skill-based matching
- Convention attendance matching
- Interest-based (same fandoms)
- Experience level compatibility

**Lightweight Collaboration:**
- Simple task assignment
- Shared deadline tracking
- Quick updates (no heavy project management)
- Async-friendly (not everyone online at once)
- Mobile-first for on-the-go updates

**Team Portfolio View:**
- Public team page (optional)
- Showcase completed group projects
- Member bios and roles
- "Work with us" contact form
- Team statistics (X projects, Y conventions)

**Supabase Implementation:**

**Database Schema:**

```sql
-- Personal team created automatically
CREATE TRIGGER create_personal_team
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION create_user_personal_team();

-- Team membership tracking
teams (
  id,
  name,
  type ('personal', 'collaborative'),
  owner_id,
  is_public,
  premium_tier,
  premium_expires_at,
  member_limit,
  settings
)

team_memberships (
  team_id,
  user_id,
  role,
  joined_at,
  invited_by,
  is_personal_team -- flag for their default team
)

-- Track team limits
user_stats (
  user_id,
  teams_owned_count,
  teams_joined_count,
  premium_tier,
  can_create_more_teams -- computed
)
```

**RLS Policies:**

```sql
-- Personal team: only owner can access
CREATE POLICY "Personal team access"
  ON teams FOR ALL
  USING (
    (type = 'personal' AND owner_id = auth.uid())
    OR
    (type = 'collaborative' AND id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_memberships 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ))
  );
```

**Edge Functions:**

```javascript
// Check if user can create team (respects tier limits)
export async function canCreateTeam(userId, tier) {
  const { count } = await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
    .eq('owner_id', userId)
    .eq('type', 'collaborative');
  
  const limits = {
    free: 0,
    premium: 3,
    team_premium: 10
  };
  
  return count < limits[tier];
}
```

**Svelte Store for Team Context:**

```javascript
// stores/team.js
import { writable, derived } from 'svelte/store';

export const currentTeam = writable(null);
export const personalTeam = writable(null);
export const userTeams = writable([]);

export const isPersonalTeam = derived(
  [currentTeam, personalTeam],
  ([$current, $personal]) => $current?.id === $personal?.id
);

export const teamPremiumFeatures = derived(
  currentTeam,
  ($team) => {
    // Check if team has premium or user has premium
    return $team?.premium_tier || userHasPremium();
  }
);
```

**Team Creation Flow:**

1. User clicks "Create Team"
2. Check tier limits
3. If at limit → Upgrade prompt
4. Simple form: Name, Description, Type
5. Optionally invite members immediately
6. Created with basic template

**Team Invitation:**

```javascript
// Generate invite link
const inviteLink = await generateInviteLink(teamId, {
  expiresIn: '7d',
  maxUses: 10,
  requireApproval: false
});

// Or direct invite
await inviteUser({
  teamId,
  email: 'friend@example.com',
  role: 'member',
  message: 'Join our group cosplay!'
});
```

**Discord Integration via Supabase:**

```javascript
// Store Discord webhook in team settings
teams.settings = {
  discord: {
    webhookUrl: 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...',
    notifications: ['task_assigned', 'milestone', 'photoshoot'],
    channel_id: '123456789'
  }
}

// Edge function to send Discord notifications
export async function notifyDiscord(teamId, event) {
  const team = await getTeam(teamId);
  if (!team.settings?.discord?.webhookUrl) return;
  
  await fetch(team.settings.discord.webhookUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      embeds: [{
        title: event.title,
        description: event.description,
        color: 0x5865F2,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      }]
    })
  });
}
```

**Key UX Considerations:**

**Clear Context Switching:**
- Dropdown to switch between teams
- Visual indicator of current team
- "Personal" vs team name clearly labeled
- Quick access to all teams

**Project Ownership:**
- Projects belong to teams, not users
- Can transfer project between your teams
- Request transfer to/from collaborative team
- Clear ownership in UI

**Permission Model (Simple):**
- Owner: Full control
- Admin: Manage members, edit all projects
- Member: Edit assigned projects, view all
- Viewer: Read-only (for guests/clients)

**Upgrade Prompts:**
- Hit team limit → "Upgrade to join more teams"
- Team needs premium feature → "Upgrade this team" or "Your premium works here!"
- Storage limit → "Upgrade for more space"
- Non-intrusive, contextual

**Questions:**

Should personal teams be renameable or always "Your Workspace" / "[Name]'s Team"?

For team premium - should it be recurring or one-time unlock per team?

Should team invites require email or work with username/in-app only?

How should project transfer work if someone leaves a team? (Auto-transfer to owner? Member chooses destination?)

Would you want team achievement badges/stats public or private?

Should free users be able to create collaborative teams at all, or is that premium-only?



## Prompt:

I was thinking for open teams there could be temp teams for a certain shoot and ways to search for open shoots like an all demon slayer shoot. I have personal team name customization but idk if I should keep it. I think there should a recurring payments or a large one time lifetime subscription with limits on things like ai. I think I want to enforce email at minimum but if not at least a username. If a team is deleted then all projects are cancelled but if the owner wants to leave the must select some to take ownership



## Response:

Great clarifications! The temp team concept for specific shoots is really smart - that's a common real-world need. Let me refine these ideas:

**Temp/Event Teams (Open Shoots)**

**Concept:**
Short-lived teams for specific photoshoots or events that dissolve after completion.

**Use Cases:**
- "Demon Slayer Group Shoot - Oct 28 @ Central Park"
- "Genshin Impact Beach Shoot - Summer 2025"
- "Anime NYC 2025 Meetup - Friday Group"
- "Studio Day Rental - 5 slots available"
- "Elden Ring Cosplay Collab"

**Temp Team Features:**

**Creation:**
- Set expiration date (auto-archive after event)
- Max participant limit
- Requirements (characters needed, skill level, etc.)
- Location and time
- Public or invite-only
- Free to create (even for free tier users)

**Discovery Board:**
```
Search/Filter by:
- Fandom/Series
- Location/Distance from you
- Date range
- Photographer available (yes/no)
- Skill level (beginner-friendly, experienced)
- Costume requirements
- Spots available
```

**Temp Team Lifecycle:**
```
Created → Open for joining → Event happens → 
Auto-archive (7 days after event) → 
Optional: Convert to permanent team
```

**During Active Period:**
- Shared shot list planning
- Attendance confirmation
- Location details and parking info
- Weather backup plan
- Outfit coordination
- Photo delivery folder
- Post-event: Photo gallery shared with all participants

**After Event:**
- Photos remain accessible
- Automatic export option (download all before archive)
- "Work with again" - easily invite same people to new temp team
- Memories/recap view
- Convert to permanent team if group wants to continue

**Privacy Options:**
- Public listing (anyone can find and request to join)
- Unlisted (need link to find)
- Invite-only (no public discovery)
- Location hidden until confirmed participant

**Safety Features:**
- Public profile verification (show account age, completed events)
- Rating/review from past temp teams
- Report system
- "Bring a friend" encouragement
- Meet in public locations only (for public temp teams)
- Optional: Link to verified social media

**Database Schema:**

```sql
temp_teams (
  id,
  name,
  description,
  fandom_tags,
  event_date,
  location_lat_lng,
  location_name,
  created_by,
  max_participants,
  current_participants_count,
  status ('open', 'full', 'completed', 'archived'),
  expires_at,
  auto_archive_at,
  requirements, -- json: characters needed, etc.
  visibility ('public', 'unlisted', 'private')
)

temp_team_participants (
  temp_team_id,
  user_id,
  character_name,
  role ('organizer', 'photographer', 'cosplayer'),
  status ('interested', 'confirmed', 'attended'),
  joined_at
)

temp_team_requests (
  temp_team_id,
  user_id,
  message,
  character_bringing,
  status ('pending', 'approved', 'declined')
)
```

**Personal Team Naming:**

I'd say **keep customization** but with smart defaults:

**Default Names:**
- "[Username]'s Workspace" (can rename)
- Shows in dropdown as: "Personal" with custom name as subtitle

**Benefits of Custom Names:**
- Professional commissioners: "Luna's Cosplay Commissions"
- Branding: Matches their social media handle
- Fun: "Chaos Craft Corner"
- Makes it feel more personal

**UI Treatment:**
```

  teamId,
  expiresIn: '7d',
  maxUses: 5,
  requireApproval: true
});

// Share via: Discord, Twitter, anywhere
// Landing page shows team info before joining
```

**Team Deletion & Ownership Transfer:**

**When Owner Wants to Leave:**

**Flow:**
```
1. Owner clicks "Leave Team"
   
2. System checks:
   - Are there other admins? → Offer to transfer to admin
   - Only members? → Must promote someone to owner
   - Only owner? → Must delete team or invite someone first

3. Transfer UI:
   "Transfer ownership of 'Straw Hat Crew' and leave"
   
   [ ] Transfer all my projects to new owner
   [ ] Take my projects to: [Select destination team ▼]
   [ ] Delete my projects (confirm separately)
   
   New owner: [Select member ▼]
   
4. Confirm transfer

5. Owner leaves, new owner notified
```

**When Team is Deleted:**

**Owner-Initiated Deletion:**
```
"Delete 'Straw Hat Crew'?"

⚠️ This will:
- Remove 15 members
- Cancel 3 active commissions (notify clients)
- Archive 12 completed projects
- Delete 8 scheduled posts
- Free up 45GB of storage

Before deleting:
[ ] Notify all members (send email)
[ ] Export team data (recommended)
[ ] 7-day grace period before permanent deletion

What happens to projects:
( ) Archive all (members can still view read-only)
( ) Delete all immediately
( ) Let members claim projects (they pick destination)

[Cancel] [Schedule Deletion]
```

**Supabase Implementation:**

```javascript
// Edge function for ownership transfer
export async function transferTeamOwnership({
  teamId,
  currentOwnerId,
  newOwnerId,
  projectActions // array of {projectId, action: 'transfer'|'take'|'delete'}
}) {
  
  // Start transaction
  const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('transfer_ownership', {
    team_id: teamId,
    current_owner: currentOwnerId,
    new_owner: newOwnerId,
    project_actions: projectActions
  });
  
  // Handle projects
  for (const action of projectActions) {
    if (action.action === 'transfer') {
      await supabase
        .from('projects')
        .update({ owner_id: newOwnerId })
        .eq('id', action.projectId);
    } else if (action.action === 'take') {
      // Move to owner's personal team
      await supabase
        .from('projects')
        .update({ 
          team_id: action.destinationTeamId,
          owner_id: currentOwnerId 
        })
        .eq('id', action.projectId);
    }
  }
  
  // Notify new owner
  await sendNotification(newOwnerId, {
    type: 'ownership_transferred',
    teamId,
    message: `You're now the owner of ${teamName}`
  });
  
  return { success: true };
}
```

**Commission Handling on Deletion:**

```javascript
// When team with active commissions is deleted
export async function handleCommissionCancellation(teamId) {
  
  const activeCommissions = await supabase
    .from('commissions')
    .select('*, client:users(*)')
    .eq('team_id', teamId)
    .in('status', ['active', 'pending', 'in_progress']);
  
  for (const commission of activeCommissions) {
    // Notify client
    await sendEmail({
      to: commission.client.email,
      subject: 'Commission Update Required',
      body: `The team handling your commission has been dissolved. 
             Please contact the commissioner directly to arrange completion.`
    });
    
    // Mark for review
    await supabase
      .from('commissions')
      .update({ 
        status: 'requires_action',
        notes: 'Team deleted - needs resolution'
      })
      .eq('id', commission.id);
    
    // Hold payments if applicable
    await stripeHoldPayment(commission.payment_id);
  }
}
```

**Grace Period Implementation:**

```javascript
// Soft delete with grace period
export async function scheduleTeamDeletion(teamId, deletionDate) {
  await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .update({
      status: 'pending_deletion',
      deletion_scheduled_at: deletionDate,
      deleted_at: null
    })
    .eq('id', teamId);
  
  // Schedule edge function to run after grace period
  // Could use Supabase Edge Functions with cron or pg_cron
}

// Allow cancellation during grace period
export async function cancelTeamDeletion(teamId) {
  await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .update({
      status: 'active',
      deletion_scheduled_at: null
    })
    .eq('id', teamId);
}
```

**Temp Team Auto-Archive:**

```sql
-- Cron job (daily) to archive expired temp teams
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'archive-expired-temp-teams',
  '0 3 * * *', -- 3 AM daily
  $$
  UPDATE temp_teams
  SET status = 'archived'
  WHERE auto_archive_at < NOW()
    AND status != 'archived';
  $$
);
```

**Questions:**

For temp teams - should participants be able to rate/review each other after the event?

Should there be a "deposit" or commitment mechanism for temp teams to reduce no-shows?

For lifetime subscriptions - would you offer upgrade pricing if someone's already paid for annual?

Should deleted teams have a "tombstone" page showing they existed but are deleted, or complete removal?

Would you want an export feature before deletion (zip file with all photos, project data, etc.)?



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 4:29:19 AM

I think each person would have a public profile (portfolio, recent events, etc) where they can be rated for any shoot. Maybe a rating system and you lose rating if you skip too many shoots without warning. Creator can send leave by date if you need to back out. Lifetime should be discounted for annual subscribers reducing over time the longer they are subscribed. Teams should archive for a time, maybe a year before complete removal to save on space. And export feature would be good



## Response:
10/21/2025, 4:30:54 AM

Excellent! A reputation system adds accountability and the archive approach is smart for both user experience and cost management. Let me detail these systems:

**Public Profile & Reputation System**

**Profile Structure:**

```javascript
user_profile {
  // Basic Info
  username,
  display_name,
  avatar_url,
  bio,
  location, // city/region only
  joined_date,
  
  // Portfolio
  featured_cosplays (array, max 6),
  completed_projects_count,
  public_projects (filterable gallery),
  
  // Social Links
  instagram_handle,
  tiktok_handle,
  twitter_handle,
  portfolio_website,
  
  // Skills & Specialties
  skills: ['sewing', 'foam_work', 'wig_styling', 'photography', '3d_printing'],
  specialty_fandoms: ['Demon Slayer', 'Genshin Impact', 'Marvel'],
  
  // Stats & Reputation
  reputation_score, // 0-100
  total_events_attended,
  events_organized,
  commissions_completed,
  on_time_rate, // percentage
  response_rate, // how quickly they respond to messages
  
  // Recent Activity (public)
  recent_events (last 5),
  upcoming_public_events,
  
  // Badges/Achievements
  badges: ['Early Adopter', 'Event Organizer', 'Reliable Attendee', '50 Events']
}
```

**Reputation System:**

**Score Components (0-100):**

```javascript
reputationScore = {
  attendance: 40, // Show up to events you commit to
  punctuality: 20, // On time to events
  communication: 20, // Response rate, advance notice for cancellations
  quality: 10, // Post-event ratings from others
  completion: 10  // Finish projects/commissions you commit to
}
```

**Attendance Tracking:**

```sql
event_attendance {
  user_id,
  event_id (temp_team_id),
  status ('confirmed', 'attended', 'no_show', 'cancelled_advance', 'cancelled_late'),
  confirmed_at,
  cancelled_at,
  notice_period_hours, // how much warning they gave
  attended_verified_by, // organizer confirms attendance
  rating_received
}
```

**Reputation Penalties & Rewards:**

**Positive Actions:**
- ✅ Attend confirmed event: +2 points
- ✅ Cancel with 72+ hours notice: 0 penalty
- ✅ Organize successful event: +5 points
- ✅ Receive 4-5 star rating: +1 point
- ✅ Complete commission on time: +3 points
- ✅ Quick response (< 24hrs): Improves response rate
- ✅ Attend 10 events in a row: +5 bonus + badge

**Negative Actions:**
- ❌ No-show (no warning): -10 points
- ❌ Cancel < 24 hours before: -5 points
- ❌ Cancel 24-48 hours before: -2 points
- ❌ Receive 1-2 star rating: -2 points
- ❌ Late commission delivery: -3 points
- ❌ Slow/no response (7+ days): Lowers response rate
- ❌ 3 no-shows in 6 months: Temporary suspension from joining events

**Score Display:**

**Rating System:**

**Post-Event Rating (Mutual):**

After temp team event ends, participants can rate each other:

```javascript
{

**Questions:**

Should archived teams be viewable by ex-members (read-only for a fee, like $5 one-time access)?

For reputation recovery - should there be a way to improve score faster after penalties (like completing X events in a row)?

Should event organizers be able to set custom leave-by dates, or always 72 hours?

Would you want "reputation tiers" with perks? (e.g., 90+ score = "Trusted Member" badge, priority in event waitlists)

For export packages - should there be an option to share the export link with team members (so everyone can download)?



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 10:43:25 AM

Archived teams should be read-only until deletion for free with export option available. Owner can restore anytime in that year. Organizers can set a custom leave-by date and severity for leaving. Reputation can effect a users ability to join events. I think it should also be simplified into simple states like actively engaged, consistent, flakey, etc. and you can improve rating by chasing positive



## Response:
10/21/2025, 10:45:14 AM

Perfect! That's a much cleaner and more user-friendly approach. Let me revise the reputation system and archive flow:

**Simplified Reputation System**

**Reputation States (Instead of numerical score):**

```javascript

    }
  },

```

**Export Package (Available Throughout):**

```javascript
// Generate export when team is archived
async function generateTeamExport(teamId) {
  const team = await getTeamData(teamId);
  
  const exportPackage = {
    metadata: {
      team_name: team.name,
      exported_at: new Date(),
      member_count: team.members.length,
      project_count: team.projects.length
    },
    
    projects: await getProjectsJSON(teamId),
    photos: await getPhotosArchive(teamId), // ZIP with folders
    messages: await getMessagesPDF(teamId),
    members: await getMembersCSV(teamId),
    timeline: await getTimelineHTML(teamId)
  };
  
  const zipUrl = await createZipArchive(exportPackage);
  
  // Store in Cloudflare R2 with 60-day expiry
  await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .update({
      export_package_url: zipUrl,
      export_generated_at: new Date(),
      export_expires_at: addDays(new Date(), 60)
    })
    .eq('id', teamId);
  
  return zipUrl;
}
```

**Member Access to Archived Team:**

```
// Anyone who was a member has read access
CREATE POLICY "Members can view archived teams"
  ON teams FOR SELECT
  USING (
    status = 'archived' 
    AND id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM archived_team_access 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

// But only owner can restore
CREATE POLICY "Owner can restore archived team"
  ON teams FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    status = 'archived'
    AND deleted_by_user_id = auth.uid()
  );
```

**Cost Optimization:**

```javascript
// Move to cold storage immediately on archive
async function archiveTeamToStorage(teamId) {
  // Cloudflare R2 cold storage is 10x cheaper
  await migrateToCloudStorage({
    teamId,
    tier: 'cold',
    // Slight compression acceptable for archived content
    compression: 'light',
    // Keep thumbnails for browsing
    generateThumbnails: true
  });
  
  // Update DB
  await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .update({ storage_tier: 'cold' })
    .eq('id', teamId);
}
```

**Implementation in Supabase:**

```javascript
// Edge function: Scheduled daily purge check
export async function checkScheduledPurges() {
  const now = new Date();
  
  // Teams hitting 1 year mark (send final warning)
  const teamsNearPurge = await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .select('*')
    .eq('status', 'archived')
    .lt('can_restore_until', addDays(now, 30))
    .gt('can_restore_until', now)
    .is('final_warning_sent', null);
  
  for (const team of teamsNearPurge) {
    await sendFinalWarningEmail(team);
    await supabase
      .from('teams')
      .update({ final_warning_sent: now })
      .eq('id', team.id);
  }
  
  // Teams past 1 year (permanent delete)
  const teamsToPurge = await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .select('*')
    .eq('status', 'archived')
    .lt('can_restore_until', now);
  
  for (const team of teamsToPurge) {
    await permanentlyDeleteTeam(team.id);
  }
}

async function permanentlyDeleteTeam(teamId) {
  // Delete from storage
  await deleteAllTeamFiles(teamId);
  
  // Keep anonymized stats for analytics
  await createAnonymizedRecord(teamId);
  
  // Mark as purged
  await supabase
    .from('teams')
    .update({
      status: 'purged',
      purged_at: new Date(),
      // Remove PII
      name: '[Deleted]',
      export_package_url: null
    })
    .eq('id', teamId);
}
```

**Questions:**

Should there be a "quick restore within 30 days" option that's faster/easier than the full year archive?

For reputation - should "Building" users be able to host events, or should there be a minimum tier (like Consistent) to create public temp teams?

Should users get notifications when they're about to drop a reputation tier? ("Warning: One more no-show will move you to Flaky status")

For archived teams - should there be a size limit on free export downloads? (e.g., teams over 50GB require premium to download)



## Prompt:
10/21/2025, 10:49:31 AM

Yes for quick restore, and any user can still host an event as a way to build rep. Notifications should help users from dropping ratings and archives over a certain size will require a fee to download after the 30 day window.

Also since I am using GitHub spec kit for spec driven development with ai, could I get this conversation summarized in a way I could use to update my constitution file and create specs to implement features?

# Cosplay Planning App - Feature Specification Summary

## Core Architecture
- **Stack**: SvelteKit, Supabase (backend), Bun, Vite
- **Target Market**: USA/English-speaking initially, future expansion to Japan/Korea
- **User Base**: Beginner to experienced cosplayers, photographers, commissioners

## Team System

### Team Structure
Every user has a **personal team** (their workspace) created automatically on signup:
- Cannot be deleted (only archived)
- User is sole owner
- Acts as portfolio
- Can be renamed by user

Users can create/join **collaborative teams**:
- Free tier: Personal team + join 1 collaborative team
- Premium: Personal team + create 3, join 5 collaborative teams
- Team Premium: Purchase premium for specific team (up to 15 members benefit)

### Team Types
1. **Personal Team**: Individual workspace, portfolio, solo projects
2. **Collaborative Teams**: Small groups (2-10 people) for group cosplays, creator collectives, convention squads
3. **Temp/Event Teams**: Short-lived teams for specific photoshoots
   - Set expiration date (auto-archive after event)
   - Public discovery board
   - Free to create for all tiers
   - Auto-archive 7 days after event
   - Optional conversion to permanent team

### Temp Team Features
- **Discovery**: Search by fandom, location, date, skill level
- **Requirements**: Character needs, max participants, skill requirements
- **Visibility**: Public listing, unlisted (link only), or private
- **Safety**: Account age display, past event ratings, report system
- **Post-Event**: Photo gallery, "work with again" easy re-invite

## Reputation System

### Simplified Tier-Based System (No numerical scores)

**Tiers** (from best to worst):
1. **🌟 Exemplary**: 20+ events, 95%+ on-time, 0 no-shows/year, 4.5+ avg rating
2. **✅ Reliable**: 10+ events, 85%+ on-time, 0 no-shows/year, 4.0+ avg rating
3. **👍 Consistent**: 5+ events, 75%+ on-time, max 1 no-show/year, 3.5+ avg rating
4. **🆕 Building Reputation**: New users or <5 events (default starting tier)
5. **⚠️ Flaky**: <70% on-time, 2+ no-shows/year, 3+ late cancellations
6. **🚫 Unreliable**: <50% on-time, 3+ no-shows/year (restricted from events)

### Reputation Calculation
- Based on last 12 months of data only
- Metrics: events attended, on-time rate, no-shows, cancellation timing, avg rating
- Recalculated after each event
- Users can improve by completing events successfully

### Event Restrictions by Tier
- **Exemplary/Reliable/Consistent**: Can join all events, auto-approved
- **Building**: Can join most events (organizer can restrict), auto-approved
- **Flaky**: Limited access, requires manual organizer approval
- **Unreliable**: Temporary ban from public events (30-90 days), very limited access

### Notifications
- Warning when about to drop tier: "One more no-show will move you to Flaky status"
- Tips for improvement shown in profile
- Clear path to next tier with specific requirements

## Event Attendance System

### Custom Leave-By Date & Severity
**Organizers set**:
- Custom leave-by date (default: 72 hours before event)
- Cancellation severity level:
  - **Lenient**: Minor penalties (community meetups)
  - **Standard**: Normal penalties (typical shoots)
  - **Strict**: Significant penalties (organized productions)
  - **Critical**: Severe penalties (group cosplays where all members essential)

### Cancellation Penalties (Standard severity example)
- 72+ hours notice: 0 penalty
- 24-72 hours notice: -2 impact
- <24 hours notice: -5 impact
- No-show: -10 impact

Severity multiplies these impacts. Critical events may trigger temporary suspensions for no-shows.

### Attendance Tracking
```sql
event_attendance {
  user_id,
  event_id,
  status: 'confirmed' | 'attended' | 'no_show' | 'cancelled_advance' | 'cancelled_late',
  confirmed_at,
  cancelled_at,
  notice_period_hours,
  attended_verified_by, // organizer confirms
  rating_received
}
```

### Post-Event Ratings
- Mutual ratings between participants
- Categories: Professionalism, Communication, Punctuality, Teamwork (1-5 stars each)
- Optional public comments
- Displayed on user profiles
- Contributes to reputation tier calculation

## Public Profiles & Portfolios

5. **⚠️ Flaky**: <70% on-time, 2+ no-shows/year, 3+ late cancellations
6. **🚫 Unreliable**: <50% on-time, 3+ no-shows/year (restricted from events)

### Reputation Calculation
- Based on last 12 months of data only
- Metrics: events attended, on-time rate, no-shows, cancellation timing, avg rating
- Recalculated after each event
- Users can improve by completing events successfully

### Event Restrictions by Tier
- **Exemplary/Reliable/Consistent**: Can join all events, auto-approved
- **Building**: Can join most events (organizer can restrict), auto-approved
- **Flaky**: Limited access, requires manual organizer approval
- **Unreliable**: Temporary ban from public events (30-90 days), very limited access

### Reputation Building
- Any user can host events (helps build reputation)
- Clear progression path shown in profile
- Tips for improvement
- Warnings before tier drops
- Positive actions rewarded (streaks, badges)

### Notifications
- Warning when about to drop tier: "One more no-show will move you to Flaky status"
- Tips for improvement shown in profile
- Clear path to next tier with specific requirements

## Event Attendance System

### Custom Leave-By Date & Severity
**Organizers set**:
- Custom leave-by date (default: 72 hours before event)
- Cancellation severity level:
  - **Lenient**: Minor penalties (community meetups)
  - **Standard**: Normal penalties (typical shoots)
  - **Strict**: Significant penalties (organized productions)
  - **Critical**: Severe penalties (group cosplays where all members essential)

### Cancellation Penalties (Standard severity example)
- 72+ hours notice: 0 penalty
- 24-72 hours notice: -2 impact
- <24 hours notice: -5 impact
- No-show: -10 impact

Severity multiplies these impacts. Critical events may trigger temporary suspensions for no-shows.

### Attendance Tracking
```sql
event_attendance {
  user_id,
  event_id,
  status: 'confirmed' | 'attended' | 'no_show' | 'cancelled_advance' | 'cancelled_late',
  confirmed_at,
  cancelled_at,
  notice_period_hours,
  attended_verified_by, // organizer confirms
  rating_received
}
```

### Post-Event Ratings

## Notes for AI-Assisted Development

### Context for AI Pair Programming
When working with AI assistants on this codebase:

1. **Always specify**: SvelteKit + Supabase + TypeScript
2. **Mention tier**: Which subscription tier the feature applies to
3. **State dependencies**: What integrations/APIs the feature uses
4. **Reference reputation**: How features interact with reputation system
5. **Consider teams**: Personal vs collaborative vs temp team context

### Common Patterns to Establish
- RLS policy patterns for different team types
- Reputation calculation triggers
- Event lifecycle hooks (created → active → completed → archived)
- Export package generation flow
- Storage tier migrations (hot → cold)

### Testing Priorities
- Reputation tier calculations
- Event eligibility checks
- Team access permissions
- Archive/restore flows
- Payment flows (Stripe integration)
- AI credit management

### Documentation Needs
- API integration guides for each service
- RLS policy documentation
- Reputation system logic
- Team lifecycle state machine
- Archive timeline flowchart
````

I've created a comprehensive markdown file with all the specifications we discussed. You can download it by clicking the download button in the artifact viewer above.

The document includes:
- Complete feature specifications
- Database schema details
