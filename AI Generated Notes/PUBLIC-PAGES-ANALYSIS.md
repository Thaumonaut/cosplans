## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **You Were Right About This Gap**

The app specs are internal-focused:
- User dashboards ✅
- Team coordination ✅
- Shoot planning ✅

But missing external facing:
- How do people discover Cosplans? ❌
- Where do they sign up? ❌
- What if they have questions? ❌
- Can they trust the team? ❌

### **This Affects Launch Success**

**Without public pages:**
- Low conversion from visitor → signup
- High support burden (no FAQ)
- Low trust (no about page)
- SEO opportunity missed
- No press coverage (no about)

**With public pages:**
- Clear value proposition
- Self-service support (FAQ)
- Build trust (team, values)
- Better SEO rankings
- Professional first impression

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

### **Option 1: Minimal (MVP Launch)**
- Landing page (simple, conversion-focused)
- About page (team & mission)
- Contact page (email form)
- Legal pages (privacy, terms)
- Basic FAQ

**Effort**: 3-4 weeks (can be done in parallel with Tier 1 specs)

### **Option 2: Moderate (Week 6 Launch)**
- Everything in Option 1 +
- Features page (detailed)
- Blog with 3-5 launch articles
- Newsletter signup
- Social proof section

**Effort**: 4-5 weeks

### **Option 3: Full (Professional Launch)**
- Everything in Option 2 +
- Community showcase gallery
- Help center (searchable KB)
- Status page
- Testimonials/case studies

**Effort**: 6-7 weeks

---

## 📝 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Add public pages to Tier 0.5**
   - Landing page (critical)
   - Legal (compliance)
   - Contact (support)

2. **Create website spec**
   - Information architecture
   - Page hierarchy

   - Legal review

4. **Plan timeline**

   - Don't block MVP launch
   - Have public pages ready by Week 6

---

## ✅ **SUMMARY**

**Critical Gap**: Public-facing presence missing  
**Impact**: Users can't discover, understand, or trust the app  
**Solution**: Add 3-5 public page specs to Tier 0.5  
**Timeline**: Build in parallel with MVP (Weeks 1-5)  
**Launch Ready**: Week 6 with professional public presence  

**This is important for:**
- First impressions
- User trust
- Legal compliance
- SEO/discoverability
