## CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### **Why Core App First Matters**

‚ùå **Old Approach**
- Start with AI features
- Assume infrastructure exists
- No clear MVP
- 20+ blockers not identified

‚úÖ **New Approach**
- Foundation specs first (Tier 0)
- Core app next (Tier 1)
- Clear MVP at Week 6
- Blockers identified & prioritized

### **The Right MVP Definition**

Users can:
- ‚úÖ Create account (auth)
- ‚úÖ Create shoot & team (shoots-teams)
- ‚úÖ Upload photos (photos)
- ‚úÖ Plan shots with references (shot-by-shot)
- ‚úÖ Manage costumes/props (costume-management)
- ‚úÖ Communicate with team (team-communication)
- ‚úÖ Track budget (budget-tracking)
- ‚úÖ Create gear checklists (gear-checklist)
- ‚úÖ View dashboard (dashboard)

### **Why AI Comes Later**

- üéØ Base features must work first
- üéØ Users don't *need* AI to use app
- üéØ AI enhances, not enables
- üéØ Build strong foundation first

### **Foundation is Mandatory**

These 5 specs MUST be created before anything else:
1. Auth - Can't use app without login
2. Shoots/Teams - Can't create content without containers
3. Photos - Can't show images without upload
4. Permissions - Can't control access without roles
5. Real-Time Sync - Can't collaborate without sync
