## How to Run Tests

### Quick Start (Windows)

```powershell
# Run all auth tests (unit + E2E)
bun run test:auth

# Run only unit tests (fast, no database needed)
bun run test:unit:auth

# Run only E2E tests (requires test database)
bun run test:e2e:auth

# Watch mode for development
bun run test:unit:watch

# Interactive UI for debugging E2E tests
bun run test:e2e:ui
```

### Test Results

**Unit Tests**: ✅ 40/40 passing (2.92s)
```
✓ tests/unit/utils/validation.test.ts (16 tests) 12ms
✓ tests/unit/auth/auth-utils.test.ts (24 tests) 24ms
```

**E2E Tests**: ⏳ Ready to run
- Requires test database setup
- See `AUTH-TESTING-GUIDE.md` for setup instructions

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Set up test database** (optional for E2E tests)
   ```sql
   -- Create test users in Supabase
   INSERT INTO auth.users (email, encrypted_password, email_confirmed_at)
   VALUES ('test@example.com', crypt('ValidP@ssw0rd123', gen_salt('bf')), NOW());
   ```

2. **Run E2E tests**
   ```powershell
   bun run test:e2e:auth
   ```

3. **Verify all tests pass**
   ```powershell
   bun run test:auth
   ```
