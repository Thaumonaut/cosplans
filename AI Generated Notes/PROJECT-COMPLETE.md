## 📋 Clarifications Needed (Low Priority - Recommended Solutions Included)

### **Spec 023 - Photo Management** (3 questions)
1. **Storage Provider**: S3 / Google Cloud / Supabase?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Supabase Storage (matches your tech stack)

2. **CDN**: CloudFront / CloudFlare / Built-in?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: CloudFlare (cost-effective, easy setup)

3. **Storage Quota**: Unlimited / Tiered / Metered?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Unlimited for MVP (add quotas in paid tiers later)

### **Spec 024 - Real-Time Sync** (3 questions)
1. **Real-Time Protocol**: WebSocket / SSE / Yjs?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Supabase Realtime + Yjs (you have Yjs 13.6 in package.json)

2. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-Write-Wins / CRDT / User-Prompted?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Yjs CRDT (automatic, transparent, most elegant)

3. **Local Storage**: IndexedDB / SQLite / localStorage?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: IndexedDB (performant, sufficient capacity for offline)

### **Spec 025 - Landing Page** (3 questions)
1. **Brand Colors**: What's your color palette?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Define during design sprint (spec has placeholder)

2. **Logo & Assets**: Where are brand files?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Create during week 1 design phase

3. **Hero Visual**: Screenshot / Video / Illustration?
   - ✅ **Recommendation**: Screenshots from working app (more credible)

**Bottom Line**: All clarifications have recommended defaults - proceed without answers if time-constrained.

## ✨ Key Insights

### **Foundation Layer is Critical**
The 5 Tier 0 specs (020-024) are the foundation everything else depends on:
- No user features work without Auth (020)
- No collaboration without Teams (021)
- No security without Permissions (022)
- No core value without Photos (023)
- No MVP without Real-Time Sync (024)

**Build these first, build them well.**

### **Public Presence Matters**
The 5 public page specs (025-029) are often forgotten but critical:
- Users can't discover the app without landing page (025)
- Users won't trust the app without about page (026)
- Users can't ask questions without contact page (027)
- Users won't know if features match their needs without features page (028)
- Users won't use the app without legal compliance (029)

**Build in parallel, don't save for last minute.**

### **Clear MVP is Achievable**
With Tier 0 (weeks 1-2) + Tier 1 (weeks 3-6) = 6-week MVP launch:
- 5 foundation specs (infrastructure)
- 2+ core features (dashboard, shot planning)
- 5 public pages (web presence)
- Professional features come after MVP

**Week 6 is achievable if everyone focuses on Tier 0→1 only.**

---

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### **1. Finish Tier 0 Before Starting Tier 1**
Don't start building Tier 1 features until Tier 0 foundation is solid.
- Tier 0 (Auth, Teams, Permissions, Photos, Sync) must be 100% complete
- All other features depend on these - cutting corners here breaks everything
- Expected: Weeks 1-2 FULL-TIME focus on Tier 0

### **2. Get Legal Review Before Launch**
Spec 029 (Legal & Compliance) MUST be reviewed by legal counsel:
- Privacy policy must be reviewed (GDPR/CCPA)
- Terms of service must be finalized
- DPA with subprocessors required
- **Don't launch without this** - legal liability is massive

### **3. Gather Branding/Content Early**
Public pages specs (025-028) need content ASAP:
- Branding assets (logo, colors, fonts) needed for design
- Team bios and photos needed for about page
- Company history/press mentions for credibility
- This can start in parallel with development

### **4. Make Technology Decisions Now**
Use recommended solutions for the 3 clarification questions:
- Storage: Supabase Storage
- Real-Time: Supabase Realtime + Yjs
- Offline: IndexedDB

**Don't waste time researching - use recommendations.**
