## 🔴 MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES (Must Create First)

### **TIER 0: FOUNDATION (5 specs) - WEEKS 1-2**

These foundation specs must be completed BEFORE any Tier 1 work:

```
000-auth-user-management
  └─ User registration, login, OAuth, sessions, MFA
  └─ Enables: Everything else

000-shoots-teams-creation
  └─ Create/edit shoots, create/edit teams
  └─ Enables: All shoot-related features

000-photo-management
  └─ Upload, storage, organization, permissions
  └─ Referenced by: 7+ existing specs

000-permissions-access-control
  └─ Role-based access (Owner/Admin/Coordinator/Member/Viewer)
  └─ Consolidate from scattered definitions

000-realtime-sync-offline
  └─ WebSocket sync, conflict resolution, offline queueing
  └─ Critical for: Chat, checklists, budgets
```

👉 **Create these immediately - everything depends on them.**

---

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY SUPPORT SPECS (Recommended)

### **TIER 0.5: SUPPORT SYSTEMS - WEEKS 2-3**

```
000-search-filtering
  └─ Global search, advanced filters, saved searches

000-calendar-system
  └─ Unified calendar (currently scattered across specs)

000-notification-system
  └─ Push/email/SMS notifications

000-file-asset-management
  └─ File upload, versioning, permissions
```

👉 **Build these before or alongside Tier 1.**

## ✅ NEXT ACTIONS

### **This Week**
- [ ] Read all documentation
- [ ] Review feature gaps with team
- [ ] Decide Tier 0 implementation approach

### **Next Week**
- [ ] Create Tier 0 specs (000-auth, 000-shoots-teams, etc.)
- [ ] Consolidate permissions (from spec 004)
- [ ] Start architecture planning

### **Following Week**
- [ ] Assign story points
- [ ] Finalize team assignments
- [ ] Begin infrastructure work

---

## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS

### **Why This Order Works**

1. **Tier 0 is mandatory** - Everything depends on foundation specs
2. **Tier 1 is cohesive** - 6 core specs that work together
3. **Dashboard first** - Users see it on login
4. **Shot planning central** - App is organized around shoot planning
5. **AI is enhancement** - Not required for MVP
6. **Portfolio is last** - Makes sense after shots exist

### **What Was Wrong Before**

- ❌ Specs assumed features that didn't exist (auth, photos, permissions)
- ❌ AI features came before core app
- ❌ No clear MVP definition
- ❌ No consideration of dependencies
- ❌ Calendar/notifications scattered across specs

### **What's Better Now**

- ✅ Clear MVP at Week 6 with 6 core specs
- ✅ Foundation specs establish architecture
- ✅ Dependencies mapped explicitly
- ✅ AI features properly positioned as enhancements
- ✅ Clear implementation path (Tiers 0-5)

## 🔗 DEPENDENCIES AT A GLANCE

```
Tier 0 (Foundation)
    ↓
Tier 1 (MVP - Core App)
    ├─→ Tier 2 (Professional Tools)
    │    ├─→ Tier 3 (AI & Creative)
    │    │    └─→ Tier 4 (Specialized)
    │    │         └─→ Tier 5 (Portfolio)
```

**Key Point**: You cannot skip Tiers. Tier 0 → Tier 1 → others.
