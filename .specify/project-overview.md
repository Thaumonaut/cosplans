## Priority Breakdown

### 🚨 Foundation Layer (P0) - **0/5 complete** - CRITICAL PATH
**Status**: Not started - **BLOCKS 90% OF OTHER FEATURES**

These are the constitutional foundation specs that must be completed before most other features:

1. **020-user-authentication** (0%)
   - Dependencies: None
   - Blocks: All authenticated features (002-017, 021-024, 030-040)
   - **START HERE** ⭐

2. **021-shoots-teams-creation** (0%)
   - Dependencies: 020
   - Blocks: 002, 004, 006, 009, 012, 013, 017, 022

3. **022-permissions-access-control** (0%)
   - Dependencies: 020, 021
   - Blocks: All features requiring RBAC

4. **023-photo-management-storage** (0%)
   - Dependencies: 020, 042
   - Blocks: 002, 007, 010, 015, 016

5. **024-realtime-sync-offline** (0%)
   - Dependencies: 020, 042
   - Blocks: 004, 011, 014

**Impact**: Until foundation is complete, can only work on infrastructure (041-042) and public pages (025-029).

---

### 🔧 Infrastructure (Ongoing) - **2/5 in progress**

Independent cross-cutting systems that enhance all features:

- ✅ **001-dashboard-views** (43% - P1) - Dashboard system MVP started
- 🔄 **041-sidebar-navigation** (42% - Paused at Phase 2)
  - Remaining: Theme system, notifications, route integration
  - No blockers - can resume anytime
- 🔄 **042-backend-setup** (88% - Nearly complete)
  - Remaining: US3 (health monitoring), US4 (error reporting)
  - No blockers - quick win available
- 📋 **031-notification-system** (0% - Waiting)
- 📋 **032-calendar-system** (0% - Waiting)

---

## Dependency Graph

### Critical Path (Foundation Layer)
```
START → 020 (Auth) → 021 (Teams) → 022 (Permissions)
                  ↓
         042 (Backend) → 023 (Storage) → Feature development
                      ↓
                    024 (Realtime) → Collaborative features
```

### Ready to Implement (No Blockers)
✅ **Can start immediately**:
1. **020-user-authentication** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. **042-setup-and-connect** (88% done - quick win)
3. **041-sidebar-navigation** (resume Phase 2)
4. **025-public-landing-page** (independent)
5. **026-029** (all public pages - independent)

### Blocked Specs Waiting on Foundation
🔒 **Cannot start until 020-024 complete** (30+ specs):
- All core features: 002, 004, 006, 007, 009, 010, 011, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017

---

## Constitution Compliance Check

### ✅ Compliant
- **Runtime**: All specs use Bun (no Node.js/npm references found)
- **Testing**: Test tasks present in 001, 041, 042 specs
- **Tech Stack**: Following approved stack (SvelteKit, Tailwind, Supabase)

### ⚠️ Monitoring
- **Test Coverage**: Need to verify 70% minimum once more features implemented
- **Foundation Gap**: 0/5 foundation specs complete - critical blocker

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### 🎯 Immediate Actions (This Week)

**Option A: Critical Path (Recommended)**
1. **START: 020-user-authentication** ⭐
   - No dependencies, unblocks 30+ specs
   - Estimated: 1-2 weeks
   - Use speckit workflow: `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`

**Option B: Quick Wins (Parallel)**
2. **FINISH: 042-setup-and-connect** (only 5 tasks left!)
   - Complete US3 (health monitoring) and US4 (error reporting)
   - Estimated: 2-3 days
   - Provides backend stability for foundation work

3. **RESUME: 041-sidebar-navigation** (33 tasks remaining)
   - Complete Phase 2: Smart redirect, unsaved changes modal, tests
   - Move to Phase 3: Theme system
   - Estimated: 1 week
   - Provides navigation infrastructure for all features

### 📅 Phase 1 Roadmap (Next 4-6 Weeks)

**Week 1-2**: Foundation Core
- ✅ Complete 042-setup-and-connect (US3-4)
- 🔥 Implement 020-user-authentication (full spec)
- 🔧 Resume 041-sidebar-navigation (finish Phase 2-3)

**Week 3-4**: Foundation Extended  
- 🔥 Implement 021-shoots-teams-creation
- 🔥 Implement 022-permissions-access-control
- 🌐 Implement 025-029 public pages (parallel work)

**Week 5-6**: Storage & Realtime
- 🔥 Implement 023-photo-management-storage
- 🔥 Implement 024-realtime-sync-offline
- ✅ Foundation complete - **30+ specs unblocked!**

### 🚀 After Foundation (Week 7+)

Once 020-024 complete, prioritize by value:
1. **High-Value Quick Wins**: 006, 008, 013 (1-2 weeks each)
2. **Core Workflows**: 002, 004, 007, 009 (2-3 weeks each)
3. **Content Management**: 010, 015, 016 (1-2 weeks each)
4. **Polish & Scale**: 030-040 (as needed)

---

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel Development Opportunities

Once foundation (020-024) is complete, these can be developed in parallel:

**Team A - Core Workflows**:
- 002-shot-by-shot
- 004-team-communication
- 009-editing-task

**Team B - Content Management**:
- 010-reference-pose-library
- 015-portfolio-gallery
- 016-costume-progress-photos

**Team C - Tools & Integrations**:
- 006-gear-checklist
- 008-weather-integration
- 011-trending-audio

### Risk Mitigation

**Current Risks**:
1. 🔴 **Foundation Bottleneck**: 0/5 foundation specs done - blocks 90% of features
2. 🟡 **Testing Coverage**: Early to measure, but must maintain 70% minimum
3. 🟢 **Tech Stack**: Well-aligned with constitution, no concerns

**Mitigation**:
- Focus all effort on 020-024 before feature work
- Write tests first (TDD) for all foundation specs
- Consider pairing on 020-021 to accelerate (highest impact)
