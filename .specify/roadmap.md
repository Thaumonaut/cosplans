| 008 | **Weather Integration** | ‚úÖ Spec Complete | `008-weather-integration` | Prevents wasted trips but users check weather apps |

**Timeline**: +6-8 weeks after MVP launch

---

## Phase 3: Team Collaboration (v1.2-1.3)

Features that improve multi-user workflows and team coordination.

| ID | Feature | Status | Branch | Why Later |
|----|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 001 | **Shoot Transfer Between Teams** | ‚úÖ Spec Complete | `001-shoot-transfer` | Edge case for team changes, not common workflow |
| 009 | **Editing Task Assignment** | ‚úÖ Spec Complete | `009-editing-task` | Important for post-shoot but planning features more critical |
| 012 | **Team Communication/Chat** | ‚è≥ Not Yet Spec'd | - | Real-time chat is nice but notes (021) cover basics |
| 021 | **Notion Integration (P2)** | ‚úÖ Spec Complete | `021-team-notes-notion` | Enhances notes but not required for core functionality |
| 013 | **Model/Photographer Release Forms** | ‚úÖ Spec Complete | `013-model-release-forms` | Legal protection for professionals, hobbyists don't need |

**Timeline**: +3-6 weeks after Phase 2

---

---

## Phase 5: Future Considerations

Ideas to explore after core product-market fit is established.

- **Team Analytics**: Track shoot completion rates, time estimates vs actual, budget accuracy
- **Marketplace Integration**: Connect with costume commissioners, prop makers, photographers for hire
- **Event Discovery**: Find local cosplay meetups, photoshoots, conventions
- **Skill Sharing**: Tutorial library, technique guides, community Q&A
- **Costume Pattern Library**: Store and share sewing patterns, 3D print files
- **Sponsorship Tools**: Track brand partnerships, sponsored content requirements

---

## Key Strategic Decisions

### ‚úÖ What Changed in This Roadmap

| Feature | Before | After | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Reference Pose Library (011)** | Medium Priority | **Phase 1 MVP** | Core to creative planning. Without it, reference management in 022 is basic file storage. |
| **Public Shoot Pages (020)** | Phase 3 Collaboration | **Phase 1 MVP** | **Main user acquisition channel**. Organic growth through viral sharing. |
| **Budget Tracking (006)** | Phase 1 MVP | **Phase 2 Enhanced** | Nice-to-have but doesn't drive signups. Spreadsheets work initially. |
| **Team Communication (012)** | High Priority | **Phase 3** | Team notes (021 P1) cover basics. Full chat can wait. |

### üéØ User Acquisition Strategy

**Viral Loop with Public Sharing**:
```
1. User creates shoot with cool references
   ‚Üì
2. Generates public link (Spec 020)
   ‚Üì
3. Shares on Reddit: "Looking for photographer for this Genshin shoot!"
   ‚Üì
4. Non-users click link ‚Üí see beautiful shoot preview
   ‚Üì
5. "I want to plan shoots like this" ‚Üí Sign up
   ‚Üì
6. New user creates their own shoot ‚Üí shares publicly
   ‚Üì
7. Loop repeats (exponential growth)
```

**Without public sharing**: Users plan privately ‚Üí no discovery ‚Üí linear growth via ads only  
**With public sharing**: Every shoot is a marketing asset ‚Üí exponential organic growth

## Feature Prioritization Criteria

When evaluating new features, consider:

1. **Constitutional Alignment**: Does it support mobile-first, real-time collaboration, visual-first content?
2. **User Acquisition Impact**: Does this help new users discover and join Cosplans?
3. **User Pain Point Severity**: How much does this problem hurt users daily?
4. **Differentiation**: Does this set us apart from generic project management tools?
5. **Development Complexity**: Can we ship value quickly?
6. **Network Effects**: Does this feature become more valuable as more users join?
