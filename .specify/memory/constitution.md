# Cosplans Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Web-First with Mobile-Responsive Architecture
All features MUST be designed with mobile responsiveness as a core requirement. The system 
will be implemented in three phases: (1) responsive web application (SvelteKit), (2) Android 
native app (Flutter), (3) iOS native app (Flutter). The web application is the primary 
initial platform using SvelteKit for optimal performance and SEO; native mobile apps built 
with Flutter provide enhanced mobile experiences with shared codebase between Android/iOS.

**Platform Deployment Strategy**:
- **Phase 1 (Web)**: SvelteKit responsive web application serving all users across devices. 
  Focus on mobile-responsive design, touch-friendly interfaces, progressive web app (PWA) 
  capabilities, and server-side rendering for SEO. All core features implemented here first.
- **Phase 2 (Android)**: Flutter native app for Android providing enhanced mobile 
  performance, offline capabilities, and native integrations (camera, notifications, 
  location services). Features ported from validated web implementation.
- **Phase 3 (iOS)**: Flutter native app for iOS with same capabilities as Android. Shared 
  Flutter codebase enables rapid deployment after Android validation.

All platforms MUST share a common backend API to ensure data consistency. UI components and 
design tokens SHOULD be shared where technically feasible to maintain visual consistency 
across platforms. Feature development follows the phase order: web → Android → iOS.

**Rationale**: Web-first deployment with SvelteKit enables rapid development, excellent 
performance (<3 sec loads on 3G), and immediate user feedback without app store delays. 
Flutter for mobile apps provides native performance with 100% code reuse between Android and 
iOS, accelerating Phases 2-3 development. Cosplayers need mobile access for on-location 
work, but web-responsive design serves this initially while building toward native app 
performance.

### II. Real-Time Collaboration 
Team members MUST be able to view and edit shared data in real-time. Changes to shoots, 
costumes, props, and schedules MUST be synchronized across all team members immediately. 
Offline capability with sync-on-reconnect is required for location scouting and remote shoots.

**Rationale**: Cosplay teams coordinate complex logistics across multiple people, locations, 
and timelines requiring instant communication and updates.

### III. External Integration Integrity
Google Maps, Google Calendar, Google Docs, and email reminder integrations MUST maintain 
data consistency. Calendar events MUST sync bidirectionally. Document summaries MUST 
preserve user edits while updating automated content. Email reminders MUST be reliable and 
respect user notification preferences. API failures MUST not corrupt local data.

**Rationale**: Teams rely on existing Google ecosystem tools and communication channels. 
Email reminders ensure critical deadlines and shoot preparations are not missed. Disrupting 
these workflows would reduce adoption and productivity.

### IV. Customizable Workflow States
Teams MUST be able to customize shoot stages (idea → planning → scheduled → editing → 
posting → complete) and costume/prop tracking stages (acquisition → in-progress → ready). 
Default workflows are provided but teams can modify stage names, add/remove stages, and 
define stage transition rules.

**Rationale**: Different cosplay teams have varying processes, skill levels, and complexity 
requirements that cannot be served by rigid predefined workflows.

### V. Visual-First Content Management
Reference images, Instagram posts/reels, and progress photos MUST be first-class content 
types with inline viewing, annotation capabilities, and organized galleries. Visual content 
MUST be accessible from multiple views (calendar, kanban, detail pages) without navigation 
friction.

**Rationale**: Cosplay is fundamentally visual art requiring constant reference to source 
material, inspiration, and progress documentation.

### VI. Test-Driven Development
Tests MUST be written before implementation for all new features. Each user story MUST have 
corresponding test coverage that verifies acceptance criteria. Tests MUST be maintained as 
features evolve to ensure functionality remains tracked and verifiable. Feature completion 
is defined as passing tests, not just code existence.

**Rationale**: Test-driven development ensures features work as intended from inception, 
provides living documentation of expected behavior, catches regressions early, and enables 
confident refactoring. Without tests, feature quality degrades over time and bugs propagate 
undetected.

## Platform Requirements

### Web Application (Phase 1)

**Performance**: Initial page load MUST complete within 3 seconds on 3G networks. Core 
features MUST be interactive within 5 seconds. Image loading MUST be progressive with 
low-resolution previews.

**Mobile Responsiveness**: All interfaces MUST adapt to screen sizes from 320px to 4K. 
Touch targets MUST meet minimum 44px size. Form inputs MUST use appropriate mobile 
keyboards. Gestures (swipe, pinch-to-zoom) MUST be supported where relevant.

**Progressive Web App**: Service workers MUST enable offline read access to cached shoot 
details and reference images. Background sync MUST queue offline edits for later submission.

**Browser Support**: Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Mobile 
browsers: Chrome (Android), Safari (iOS).

### Native Mobile Apps (Phases 2-3)

**Offline Capabilities**: Full read/write access to shoots, costumes, props, and reference 
images MUST work offline. Changes MUST sync automatically when connection resumes with 
conflict resolution.

**Native Integrations**: Camera integration for reference photo capture. Push notifications 
for shoot reminders and team updates. Location services for venue discovery. Native sharing 
to social media platforms.

**Performance**: App launch MUST complete within 2 seconds. Battery usage MUST not exceed 
social media app benchmarks during normal usage.

**Platform Parity**: Android and iOS apps MUST have identical features. UI/UX may adapt to 
platform conventions (Material Design vs. Human Interface Guidelines).

## Development Workflow

**Feature Priority Order**: Core CRUD operations for shoots (SvelteKit web) → Mobile-responsive UI → 
Calendar integration → Google Maps integration → Advanced views (kanban, map) → 
Instagram integration → Document generation → Flutter Android app development → Flutter iOS app development.

**Platform Development Flow**:
1. Implement feature in SvelteKit web app with mobile-responsive design
2. Validate with users on web and mobile browsers
3. Port to Flutter Android app (if Phase 2 active)
4. Deploy to iOS using shared Flutter codebase (if Phase 3 active)

**Testing Requirements**: Tests MUST be written before implementation (test-first approach). 
Every user story MUST have corresponding tests for web responsive behavior. Integration 
tests MUST verify Google API interactions. Performance tests MUST validate mobile network 
conditions. Native app features MUST have platform-specific tests. Test coverage MUST be 
maintained as features evolve.

**Code Review Gates**: Test coverage and passing status verification required before review. 
Mobile-responsive UI changes require testing on multiple device sizes and browsers. External 
API integrations require error handling and fallback behavior review. Database schema 
changes require migration plan approval.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all feature decisions and architectural choices. All pull requests 
MUST verify mobile-responsive compliance, integration integrity, and test-driven development 
compliance. Feature complexity beyond core cosplay workflows MUST be justified against user 
adoption impact.

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require documentation of impact on existing 
integrations and mobile performance. Major principle changes require user feedback 
validation.
