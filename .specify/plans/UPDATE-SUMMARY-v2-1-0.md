| Creator Profiles | Public username (separate from real name), bio, roles, rates, portfolio links, verification badge              |
| Discovery        | Search by role, location (configurable distance), date availability, rating, verified status                   |
| Bookings         | Teams invite creators to shoots via email; creators accept/decline; automatic crew assignment                  |
| Payments         | Stripe integration, escrow model, commission calculation, creator payouts, team budget management              |
| Reviews          | 5-star ratings after shoot completion & payment, bidirectional (teams review creators, vice versa)             |
| Moderation       | User reports → admin queue → actions (warning, suspension, termination); verification badge revocation         |
| Showcase         | Verified creators can submit recent projects; displayed chronologically, user-driven (no algorithmic curation) |
| Analytics        | Creator earnings dashboard, conversion funnel, repeat client rate, paid tier analytics                         |

### Revenue Model (Updated)

**Old Model** (v2.0.0):

- Storage-based: 2GB free, 20GB paid
- Fixed team pricing: $5/month
- Infrastructure cost: ~$50/month per team

**New Model** (v2.1.0):

- Commission-based: 5% free tier, 0% paid tier
- Transaction cap: 50/month for free users (prevents abuse)
- Aligns platform revenue with platform adoption (more bookings = more commission)
- Break-even: ~200 creators OR 100 teams + 50 creators (Year 1 achievable)

**Rationale**: Revenue scales with ecosystem growth; incentivizes team adoption of paid tier (0% commission saves money after $100/month spend); encourages creator upgrades (0% commission makes sense at scale)

## Questions & Decisions for Team

1. **Stripe Integration Timeline**: Should Stripe be set up immediately for Phase 1, or wait until Phase 1.5 marketplace?
   - **Recommendation**: Set up in Phase 1 prep (easier to validate early); implement payment UI in Phase 1.5

2. **Creator Verification Criteria**: Are the proposed metrics (90 days, 4.5+ rating, 5+ monthly bookings) right for your community?
   - **Recommendation**: Start conservative, adjust after Phase 1.5 feedback

3. **Commission Rate**: Is 5% the right rate for free tier? (Breakeven assumes ~$50/creator/month)
   - **Recommendation**: Validate with early creators; can adjust if needed before public launch

4. **Launch Strategy**: Beta launch with trusted creators first, or public launch?
   - **Recommendation**: Beta launch (100-200 creators) for 4 weeks before public; gather feedback

5. **Mobile App Priority**: Keep Flutter for Phase 2, or accelerate?
   - **Recommendation**: Stay with Phase 2 (marketplace needs maturity on web first)
