### Antipatterns (DO NOT USE)

| Technology | Reason | Alternative |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Redux, Pinia, Zustand | State management overkill for SvelteKit | Use SvelteKit `load()` + writable stores |
| Third-party analytics vendors | Privacy concerns, PII risk | Custom PostgreSQL analytics (Constitution Principle IX) |
| Auth0, Okta | Vendor lock-in, unnecessary complexity | Supabase Auth (sufficient, decoupled) |
| Material Design, Bootstrap | Heavy, less customizable | Shadcn/svelte (lightweight, accessible) |
| Firebase | Real-time but vendor lock-in | Supabase (open-source PostgreSQL alternative) |
| Socket.io | WebSocket alternative | Use Supabase Realtime directly (built-in to PostgreSQL subscriptions) |

### Legacy Technology (Replaced in v2.2.0)

| What Was | Reason for Change | Now Using |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Manual OT Algorithm | Algorithmically complex (10-14 days dev) | Yjs CRDT (battle-tested, automatic) |
| Redux/Pinia | Overkill for app state | SvelteKit built-in stores + load() |
| Custom API mocking | Flaky external tests (5-7 days setup) | MSW (deterministic, no real API calls) |
| Scattered permissions | Permission checks scattered in code | @casl/ability (centralized, declarative) |
| Bootstrap/Material | Generic, heavy, less customizable | Shadcn/svelte (copy-paste, lightweight) |

### Core Infrastructure

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | SvelteKit | Built-in performance (SSR, ISR), no hydration lag |
| **Backend** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | EU region (GDPR), PostgREST API, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions |
| **Real-time** | Yjs + Supabase Realtime | CRDT handles conflicts automatically, 2-second propagation |
| **Images** | Sharp.js + Supabase Storage | WebP optimization, responsive sizes (320/640/1280/2560px) |
| **Authentication** | OAuth + Passkeys | No passwords, multi-provider support (Google, Instagram, X) |
| **Email** | SendGrid | Reliable delivery, webhook events, retry queue |
| **Payment** | Stripe Connect | Creator disbursements, webhook sync (Phase 1.5+) |
