**Status**: Applied to constitution.md

---

## Summary of Changes

Constitution v2.1.0 adds comprehensive support for the Creator Community & Discovery Marketplace, a Phase 1.5 feature that transforms Cosplans into a two-sided marketplace connecting cosplay teams with professional creators (photographers, makeup artists, prop modelers, etc.).

### Key Additions

#### 1. New Principle VIII: Creator Community & Discovery Marketplace

**Added comprehensive marketplace principle covering**:
- Creator public profiles (optional opt-in)
- Geographic search with distance filtering
- Role-based discovery (photographer, makeup artist, etc.)
- Verification badges for trusted creators (90+ days, 4.5+ rating, 5+ monthly bookings)
- Crew assignment integration (search creators when adding crew to shoot)
- One-click invitation system via email
- Booking management for free/paid tiers
- Commission-based revenue model (5% free tier, 0% paid tier)
- Review & moderation system
- Community showcase for verified creators' work
- Creator privacy controls (public username separate from real name)

#### 2. Updated Sustainability Model

**Commission-Based Revenue** (replacing storage-only model):
- **Team Free Tier**: 5% commission on creator payments
- **Team Paid Tier**: 0% commission (incentive to book more creators)
- **Creator Free Tier**: 5% commission on earnings
- **Creator Paid Tier**: 0% commission (incentive to upgrade)
- **Transaction Cap**: Max 50 transactions/month per free user (prevents abuse)
- **Break-Even**: ~200 active creators OR 100 teams + 50 creators in paid tier (Year 1 achievable)

**Rationale**: Revenue increases with platform adoption (more bookings = more commission); aligns incentives with creator success; supports long-term sustainability through organic growth.

#### 3. Updated Authentication

**Public Username Support**:
- Separate public username from real name
- Enables creator marketplace discoverability
- Users can hide real identity on public profiles
- Team members remain private (non-creators)

#### 4. Updated Data Privacy

**Creator Marketplace Consent**:
- Explicit opt-in for creator marketplace participation
- Consent for profile visibility, geographic search, booking history, team reviews
- Granular privacy controls (toggle public profile, hide location, set travel distance)

2. Mobile-responsive UI (Phase 1) ✅
3. Calendar integration (Phase 1) ✅

### Revenue Model Implications

**Year 1 Projections** (Conservative):

- 10 paid tier creators at $5/month = $50/month
- 50 free tier teams at $20/month avg spend = $50/month
- 5 paid tier teams at $5/month = $25/month
- **Total**: ~$175/month at Year 1 end

**Year 2 Growth**:
- Assumes 3-5x growth (platform effects, word-of-mouth)
- Target 500-1000 creators, 200-300 teams
- Revenue: $2000-5000/month (breakeven achieved)

### Business Impact

**For Teams**:

- Transparent booking & payment workflow
- No markup (0% commission on paid tier)
- Team budget management for shoot funds

**For Creators**:
- Build reputation through verified bookings & reviews
- Earn money for specialized skills
- Geographic autonomy (set travel distance, out-of-range exceptions)
- Privacy (optional public profile, real name hidden option)

**For Platform**:
- Sustainable revenue from transaction commissions
- Organic growth driver (more creators → better for teams → more teams → more creators)
- Differentiation from Fiverr/TaskRabbit (cosplay-specific, community-driven)
- Path to profitability without predatory pricing

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** with existing Phase 1 features:
- Team-based permissions unchanged

### Security & Privacy Considerations

**Creator Safety**:
- Private profiles (default) - only visible if opt-in

- Report & moderation system prevents harassment
- Location privacy (zip code level, not exact address)
- Out-of-range exceptions prevent pressure to book distant shoots

**Team Safety**:
- Review system validates creator quality
- Stripe escrow protects payment (team funds held until shoot completion)
- Contract-free bookings (rating-based enforcement)

**Data Privacy**:
- Creator data minimization (no unnecessary PII collection)
- GDPR compliance (EU data residency, explicit consent)
- Payment data handled by Stripe (PCI compliance delegated)

### Compliance Notes

- ✅ GDPR compliant (EU data residency, explicit consent, right to erasure)
- ✅ PCI DSS compliant (Stripe handles payment card data)
- ✅ FTC requirements (transparent pricing, no deceptive practices)
- ✅ Section 508 (ongoing accessibility compliance)

| IV. Customizable Workflows | Creator roles customizable; verification criteria configurable by admin |
| V. Visual-First | Creator portfolio (photos/links) displayed prominently |
| VI. Test-Driven | Comprehensive test specs in creator-community-marketplace-v1.md |

### Known Limitations & Deferred Features

**Phase 1.5 Scope**:
- ✅ Creator profiles, search, invitations
- ✅ Basic booking & payment processing
- ✅ Review system & moderation

**Phase 2+** (Deferred):
- Referral rewards program (Creator recommends friend → earn commission)
- Advanced creator analytics (trend forecasting, seasonality)

**Why Deferred**:
- Creator marketplace must prove product-market fit on web first

- Mobile apps (Flutter) come before B2B services
- Referral program introduces legal complexity (requires compliance review)
