## Revenue Model (Updated)

### Old Model (v2.0.0)
- Storage-based pricing (2GB free, 20GB paid)
- Fixed subscription: $5/month per team
- Infrastructure-focused cost model
- No creator monetization

### New Model (v2.1.0)
- Commission-based pricing (5% free tier, 0% paid tier)
- Transaction-based revenue (grows with platform adoption)
- Aligns platform incentives with creator success
- Supports two-sided marketplace economics
- Sustainable without predatory pricing

### Economics Example
**Scenario**: 200 creators, 100 teams in Year 1
- Free tier creators: $50/month × 5% commission = $50/month
- Paid tier creators ($5/month): $100 × $5 = $500/month  
- Free tier teams: $50/month × 5% commission = $50/month
- Paid tier teams ($5/month): 50 × $5 = $250/month
- **Total**: $850/month → Profitable at Year 1 end

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1.5 for marketplace** | Allows core features to stabilize before two-sided market | Launch simultaneously with Phase 1 (riskier) |
| **5% commission model** | Sustainable, aligns incentives, less extractive than alternatives | 10-20% (less competitive), membership fees (less adoption) |
| **Opt-in creator profiles** | Respects privacy, prevents spam marketplace | Mandatory for all users (invasive) |
| **Email invitations** | Low friction, async, works offline | In-app only (requires login) |
| **Stripe Connect** | Industry standard, reduces payment complexity | Custom payment logic (complex, risky) |
| **Review after completion** | Prevents fake reviews, real experience-based | Review immediately (could be inaccurate) |
| **Verification badges** | Community reputation system, not money-based | Featured listings or ads (pay-to-play) |
| **Deferred Stripe** | Allows marketplace validation before payment complexity | Implement immediately (premature) |

## Questions for the Team

Before Phase 1 kickoff, consider:

1. **Stripe Timing**: Set up immediately (Phase 1) or wait until Phase 1.5?
2. **Verification Criteria**: Are 90 days, 4.5⭐, 5+ bookings/month right for your community?
3. **Commission Rate**: Is 5% the right free tier rate? (Affects break-even calculation)
4. **Launch Strategy**: Beta with trusted creators first, or public launch?
5. **Creator Onboarding**: Who will help recruit first 50 creators?
