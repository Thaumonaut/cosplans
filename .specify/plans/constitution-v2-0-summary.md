‚úÖ OAuth scope: minimal (only what needed)  
‚úÖ Audit logging: all posts, edits, approvals  
‚úÖ Rate limiting: respect Instagram API limits  
‚úÖ Privacy: drafts only visible to team members  
‚úÖ Immutability: posted content cannot be edited (prevents data sync issues)

## Deferred Decisions (Revisit Later)

### Stripe Payment Processing

**Status**: Deferred until paid tier feature set solidified  
**Next Steps**: Define what features justify paid tier, then implement Stripe  
**Timeline**: Phase 1.5 or Phase 2

### SMS Reminders

**Status**: Deferred as paid-tier option  
**Reason**: Cost per SMS ($.005-0.02); email-only sufficient for Phase 1  
**Alternative**: Email reminders + optional Twilio SMS as upsell  
**Timeline**: Phase 2+ (if demand justifies)

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Anime Expo Convention Coverage

```
Owner schedules: "Anime Expo Photoshoot - Saturday"
Members create drafts:
  - BTS: "Makeup time!" (template: BTS captions + convention hashtags)
  - Finished: "The look complete!" (custom)
  - Convention: "Floor coverage" (template: convention captions)

Admin reviews all drafts:
  - Edits hashtags for consistency
  - Approves all three

Saturday during event:
  - BTS post scheduled to post at 3pm ‚úÖ
  - Finished post scheduled for 6pm ‚úÖ
  - Convention photos posted manually as available

Next week:
  - See analytics: Finished got 2.5K reach, 180 saves (high-performing)
  - Finished hashtags: #cosplay #animexpo trending among followers
  - Team decides to focus future posts on convention format
```

### Scenario 2: Cross-Team Collaboration

```
Team A shoots with Team B
Both teams linked to shared Instagram account

Team A member creates draft: "Collaboration magic!"
Draft submitted for approval

Team B admin approves the draft
Draft published to shared Instagram account

Both Team A and Team B see post in their analytics
Both teams' members credited as collaborators
```

### Scenario 3: Mobile Viewing (Phase 1 responsive)

```
Member opens Cosplans on mobile (during convention)
Navigates to Content Calendar
Sees upcoming posts scheduled for today
Clicks "View Draft" on "The Look" post
Draft editor opens with preview mockup
Sees: image, caption, hashtags
Swipes back to calendar
