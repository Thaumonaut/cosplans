**Focus**: Database schema, API scaffold, authentication foundations  
**Deliverable**: GitHub PR with database migrations + CRUD API endpoints  
**Team**: [Assignment: assign developer(s) here]

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Database & Schema
- [ ] **Supabase Project Created**
  - Region: EU (GDPR compliance - Principle VII: Security)
  - Project name: `cosplans-phase-1`
  - Database initialized with schema migrations

- [ ] **12 Core Tables Created** (with migrations)
  ```
  - users (id, email, username, real_name, auth_metadata, created_at)
  - teams (id, name, owner_id, created_at, updated_at)
  - team_members (id, team_id, user_id, role, invited_at, accepted_at)
  - shoots (id, team_id, title, description, scheduled_date, location, status, created_at)
  - shoot_crew (id, shoot_id, crew_id, role, assigned_by, created_at)
  - crew (id, name, email, phone, team_id, work_history, created_at)
  - costumes (id, team_id, name, description, status, acquired_date, value_usd, created_at)
  - props (id, team_id, name, description, status, created_at)
  - images (id, team_id, shoot_id, costume_id, url, storage_path, created_at)
  - permissions (id, team_id, user_id, role, created_at)
  - analytics_events (id, user_id, event_type, metadata, created_at)
  - sync_queue (id, user_id, action, data, created_at, synced_at)
  ```

- [ ] **Indexes Created** (for performance <500ms API p95)
  - shoots(team_id, scheduled_date)
  - costumes(team_id, status)
  - crew(team_id)
  - images(shoot_id, costume_id)
  - team_members(team_id, user_id)

- [ ] **Migrations Tested**
  - Up migration runs without errors
  - Down migration rolls back cleanly
  - Data integrity maintained after rollback

### Authentication & Security
- [ ] **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies**
  - All tables have RLS enabled
  - team_id policy: users can only access own team data
  - owner_id policy: only owner can delete teams
  - Test: viewer role cannot modify data (read-only)
  - Test: admin role can modify team data
  - Test: member role follows team permissions

- [ ] **JWT Token Encoding**
  - User ID encoded in JWT
  - Team IDs array encoded in JWT (users can be in multiple teams)
  - Role encoded in JWT (owner/admin/member/viewer)
  - Expiration: 30 days inactivity timeout

- [ ] **User Authentication Flow**
  - OAuth (Google) login scaffolding (not fully implemented yet)
  - Email/Passkey signup scaffolding
  - Session management (SvelteKit load hook)
  - Logout functionality

### API Endpoints (REST)
- [ ] **Shoots CRUD** (`/api/shoots`)
  - GET /api/shoots (list team's shoots, paginated)
  - POST /api/shoots (create new shoot, Zod validation)
  - GET /api/shoots/[id] (fetch shoot detail)
  - PATCH /api/shoots/[id] (update shoot)
  - DELETE /api/shoots/[id] (soft delete, owner only)

- [ ] **Costumes CRUD** (`/api/costumes`)
  - GET /api/costumes (list team's costumes, with status filter)
  - POST /api/costumes (create, Zod validation)
  - PATCH /api/costumes/[id] (update status, value, etc.)
  - DELETE /api/costumes/[id] (soft delete)

- [ ] **Props CRUD** (`/api/props`)
  - GET /api/props (list team's props)
  - POST /api/props (create)
  - PATCH /api/props/[id] (update)
  - DELETE /api/props/[id] (soft delete)

- [ ] **Crew CRUD** (`/api/crew`)
  - GET /api/crew (list team's crew with work history)
  - POST /api/crew (add new crew member)
  - PATCH /api/crew/[id] (update contact info)
  - DELETE /api/crew/[id] (archive)

- [ ] **Team Members** (`/api/teams/[team_id]/members`)
  - GET (list team members with roles)
  - POST (invite new member)
  - PATCH /[member_id] (update role: owner/admin/member/viewer)

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - 400 Bad Request (validation errors, Zod parsing failed)
  - 401 Unauthorized (missing/invalid JWT)
  - 403 Forbidden (RLS policy violated)
  - 404 Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
  - 429 Too Many Requests (rate limit hit - 1000/day free tier)
  - 500 Internal Server Error (unexpected)
  - All errors include: status, error_code, message, timestamp

- [ ] **Validation** (Zod schemas)
  - Shoot: title (1-100 chars), date (future), location (optional)
  - Costume: name (1-100), status (enum), value (numeric)
  - Crew: name, email (valid), phone (optional)
  - Team: name (1-50), owner_id (valid user)

### Testing (70% coverage minimum - Principle VI: TDD)
- [ ] **Unit Tests** (Vitest)
  - Database models: test CRUD operations
  - Zod schemas: test valid/invalid inputs
  - Permission logic: test all role combinations
  - **Target**: 25+ unit tests

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - API endpoints: test request/response/status codes
  - RLS policies: test team isolation (user X cannot see user Y's data)
  - Error handling: test 400/401/403/404/429 responses
  - **Target**: 20+ integration tests

- [ ] **API Contract Tests**
  - Request/response shapes match OpenAPI spec
  - Pagination works (limit, offset)
  - Filter parameters work (status=active, date_range, etc.)
  - **Target**: 10+ contract tests

- [ ] **Coverage Report**
  - Generate with `npm run test:coverage`
  - Minimum 70% overall
  - Flag any modules <60%
  - Commit HTML report to `.coverage/week-1-2.html`

### Documentation
- [ ] **OpenAPI/Swagger Spec** (auto-generated from SvelteKit routes)
  - All endpoints documented
  - Request/response schemas defined
  - Error responses documented
  - File: `.specify/api/v1.openapi.yaml`

- [ ] **Database Schema Diagram**
  - Visual showing all 12 tables + relationships
  - Include PK/FK constraints
  - File: `.specify/database-schema.md` (text diagram or PNG)

- [ ] **Migration Documentation**
  - How to run migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
  - How to rollback: `npm run db:rollback`
  - File: `.specify/database-migrations.md`

- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - Document all required variables
  - Supabase URL, anon key, service role key
  - File: `.env.example` (no secrets)

### Deployment & Performance
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**
  - API list endpoint: <200ms (p95) on local Supabase
  - API create endpoint: <300ms (p95)
  - Database query: <100ms (p95)
  - Document in PR description with timings

- [ ] **Database Backups**
  - Enable automated daily backups in Supabase
  - Test restoration procedure (at least once)
  - Document in `.specify/deployment.md`

- [ ] **Staging Deployment**
  - Migrations run cleanly on staging database
  - API endpoints tested in staging environment
  - No console.log() or debugger statements in code

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Blockers / Decisions Needed

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **RLS Policy Complexity** | Unclear how to handle team owner changing | Decide: soft delete old owner policy or maintain history? |
| **Offline Sync Design** | sync_queue table exists but logic not implemented | Defer to Week 5-6 (Yjs integration) |
| **OAuth Configuration** | Google OAuth secrets not available | Create mock OAuth for testing; Supabase OAuth added in Week 3 |
