# Phase 1 MVP Implementation: Week 4 Checklist

**Timeline**: Week 4 (5 working days)  
**Focus**: Image Processing + Email Integration  
**Deliverable**: GitHub PR with image upload pipeline + SendGrid email system  
**Dependency**: Week 1-3 (database + API + auth) must be merged first

---

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Image Upload & Storage

- [ ] **S3-Compatible Storage** (Supabase Storage)
  - Bucket `shoots` created in Supabase
  - Bucket `costumes` created
  - Bucket `avatars` created
  - RLS policies: only user can upload/delete own images
  - Signed URLs (expiring) generated for private images
  - Public URLs for avatars and gallery images

- [ ] **File Type Validation**
  - Accept: JPEG, PNG, WebP
  - Reject: SVG, BMP, GIF, executable files
  - File size limit: 50MB per image
  - Test: rejected files return 400 Bad Request

- [ ] **Upload Endpoint** (`POST /api/images/upload`)
  - Multipart form data: `file`, `bucket`, `folder`
  - Returns: `{ fileName, url, size, width, height, uploadedAt }`
  - Validates auth: user must be authenticated
  - Stores metadata in `images` table
  - Database fields: `id, user_id, team_id, bucket, path, size, width, height, mime_type, uploaded_at`

### Image Optimization (Sharp)

- [ ] **Responsive Image Sizes**
  - Original stored in S3
  - 4 optimized versions created:
    - **Thumbnail**: 320px (for lists)
    - **Medium**: 640px (for detail pages)
    - **Large**: 1280px (for full-screen)
    - **XL**: 2560px (for downloads)
  - All formats: WebP primary, JPEG fallback
  - Compression: 75% quality (good UX without artifacts)

- [ ] **Image Processing Pipeline**
  - Upload triggered ‚Üí queued in `image_processing_queue`
  - Background worker processes queue (frequency: every 30 seconds or batch of 10)
  - Sharp transforms image to 4 sizes
  - Uploads to S3 with naming: `{folder}/{id}-{size}.webp`, `{folder}/{id}-{size}.jpg`
  - Updates `images` table with `optimized_at` timestamp
  - Test: large image (5MB) processes within 2 seconds

- [ ] **Image Display Component** (`ImageViewer.svelte`)
  - Accepts: `src`, `alt`, `sizes`
  - Renders: `<picture>` with WebP + JPEG sources
  - Responsive: `srcset` with 320/640/1280/2560 sizes
  - Lazy loading: `loading="lazy"`
  - Aspect ratio preserved (no layout shift)

- [ ] **Image Deletion**
  - User deletes image from S3
  - All variants (320, 640, 1280, 2560) deleted
  - Database record marked `deleted_at` (soft delete)
  - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/images/{id}`

### Email Integration (SendGrid)

- [ ] **SendGrid Account Setup**
  - Account created, API key generated
  - `.env.local`: `SENDGRID_API_KEY=<key>`
  - Sender email verified: `noreply@cosplans.app`

- [ ] **Email Templates**
  - **Email Confirmation**: "Welcome to Cosplans! Verify your email"
  - **2FA Setup Confirmation**: "2FA enabled on your account"
  - **Password Reset**: "Reset your password in the next 24 hours"
  - **Shoot Invite**: "{Inviter} invited you to shoot: {ShootName}"
  - **Team Invitation**: "{TeamName} team members invited you"
  - All templates: branded with Cosplans logo, clear CTA, footer with unsubscribe

- [ ] **Email Sending Service** (`src/lib/services/email.ts`)
  - Function: `sendEmail(to, templateId, data)`
  - Returns: `{ success, messageId }`
  - Handles errors: retry on SendGrid failure (up to 3 retries, exponential backoff)
  - Logs: each email sent to `email_logs` table for auditing

- [ ] **Email Verification** (Week 3 dependency)
  - User signs up with email
  - Verification email sent immediately
  - Link: `http://cosplans.app/auth/verify?token={jwt}`
  - Link expires in 24 hours
  - User clicks link ‚Üí email marked verified, account activated

- [ ] **Transactional Email Queue**
  - Table: `email_queue`
  - Columns: `id, to_email, template_id, data, status (pending/sent/failed), created_at, sent_at`
  - If SendGrid fails ‚Üí queued, retry every 5 minutes up to 10 times
  - Cron job (every 5 min): check queue for pending emails

### Error Handling & Retry

- [ ] **Image Upload Errors**
  - Invalid format ‚Üí `400 Bad Request`
  - File too large ‚Üí `413 Payload Too Large`
  - Quota exceeded ‚Üí `429 Too Many Requests`
  - S3 unavailable ‚Üí `503 Service Unavailable`, retry after 10s

- [ ] **Email Send Errors**
  - SendGrid API down ‚Üí queued, retry after 5 min
  - Invalid email ‚Üí logged, not retried
  - Rate limited ‚Üí `429`, backoff with jitter

### Testing (70% coverage minimum)

- [ ] **Unit Tests** (Vitest)
  - Image size validation
  - MIME type checking
  - Sharp transforms (aspect ratio preservation, compression quality)
  - Email template rendering
  - **Target**: 12+ unit tests

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Image upload ‚Üí S3 storage ‚Üí metadata in DB
  - Image optimization pipeline (queue ‚Üí process ‚Üí upload)
  - Email sent via SendGrid
  - Email retry queue after SendGrid failure
  - Image deletion cascade
  - **Target**: 10+ integration tests

- [ ] **E2E Tests** (Playwright)
  - Upload image, verify in S3
  - Upload image, verify optimized sizes exist
  - ImageViewer component loads responsive image
  - **Target**: 4+ E2E tests

- [ ] **Coverage Report**
  - Minimum 70% overall
  - Generate: `npm run test:coverage`

  - How to upload images
  - Supported formats
  - Size limits
  - Optimization pipeline explained

- [ ] **Email Configuration** (`.specify/email-setup.md`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Blockers / Decisions Needed

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **SendGrid API Key** | Cannot test real email without key | Use mock SendGrid endpoint in tests; real key in staging |
| **S3 Bucket Permissions** | Must configure RLS policies | Document exact Supabase Storage policy JSON |
| **Sharp Performance** | Large images (20MB) may timeout | Set 30-second timeout; queue for background processing |
