# Sidebar Navigation Updates - October 16, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Footer User Profile Button
**Change**: Converted the sidebar footer from a static information display to a clickable link that navigates to `/settings`.

**Implementation**:
- Added user profile picture (avatar) with fallback to initials
- Entire footer is now a clickable link/button
- Shows user name and email when expanded
- Shows chevron-right icon to indicate it's clickable
- Removed connection status indicator (moved to settings page)

**Rationale**: 
- Settings items (User Account, Team Settings, Other Settings) are better organized on a dedicated settings page rather than cluttering the main sidebar
- The footer becomes a clear entry point to user/team configuration
- Reduces sidebar navigation items from 15 to 12 (Main: 6, Resources: 7)
- Connection status is better suited to a settings/system status page

### 2. Dropdown Component with Reusable Pattern
**Change**: Created a reusable `Dropdown.svelte` component used by both team switcher and theme switcher.

**Features**:
- Consistent dropdown styling across the app
- Hover effects with border and internal shadow
- Configurable alignment (left/right)
- Custom trigger styling via `triggerClass` prop
- Animated chevron on hover (drip-down and bubble-up effects)

**Usage**:
- TeamSwitcher: Shows team name as dropdown trigger in sidebar header
- ThemeSwitcher: Shows current theme selection in top header

### 3. Icon System Updates
**Change**: Added missing Lucide icons and documented the import requirement in constitution.

**Icons Added**:
- Check, ChevronDown, ChevronUp, ChevronLeft, ChevronRight
- Palette, Sun, Moon, Monitor

**Constitution Update**: Added explicit three-step process for importing icons:
1. Import from 'lucide-svelte' in `LucideIcon.svelte`
2. Add to ICONS record in `LucideIcon.svelte`
3. Add to `LucideIconName` type in `navigation.ts`

### 4. Layout Improvements
**Change**: Fixed sidebar viewport height and responsive layout.

**Improvements**:
- Sidebar uses sticky positioning on desktop with `h-[100dvh]` for viewport-height constraint
- Sidebar width transitions smoothly when collapsed/expanded (w-20 â†” w-72)
- Main content area updates dynamically when sidebar changes width
- Header actions (theme, sign out) right-aligned in top header

### 5. Theme Dropdown
**Change**: Theme dropdown now displays current theme selection (Light/Dark/System) instead of generic "Theme" label.

**Implementation**:
- Reads `$theme.mode` to determine current theme
- Label updates reactively when theme changes
- Dropdown shows all themes with checkmark next to active selection
