# Feature Specification: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance)

**Feature Branch**: `034-accessibility-wcag`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Full WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for all app features ensuring usability for users with disabilities

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Keyboard Navigation (Priority: P1)

Users who cannot use a mouse need to navigate the entire app using keyboard only, with logical tab order and visible focus indicators.

**Why this priority**: Critical for users with mobility disabilities; required for WCAG Level AA; enables power users to work faster.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by unplugging mouse and using only Tab, Enter, arrows, and Escape keys to navigate entire app; verify all features are accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is using keyboard-only navigation, **When** they press Tab, **Then** focus moves to the next interactive element in logical order
2. **Given** focus is on an interactive element, **When** user can see visible focus indicator (outline, highlight), **Then** they know which element is active
3. **Given** a user is in a modal or menu, **When** they press Tab, **Then** focus cycles within modal/menu (trap) and doesn't lose keyboard access
4. **Given** a keyboard user wants to skip repetitive elements, **When** they activate skip links, **Then** they jump to main content
5. **Given** a user encounters a dropdown or multi-level menu, **When** using arrow keys, **Then** they can navigate items; Enter selects

### User Story 2 - Screen Reader Support (Priority: P1)

Users who are blind or have low vision need all content, interface elements, and state changes to be communicated by screen readers.

**Why this priority**: Critical for blind users; required for WCAG Level AA; enables independent app usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested with screen readers (NVDA on Windows, JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac) by verifying all content is announced and interactive elements are properly labeled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** page content exists, **When** screen reader reads page, **Then** all text, headings, and content are announced in proper order
2. **Given** a button or link exists, **When** screen reader encounters it, **Then** purpose is clear (button label, link text) without relying solely on visual context
3. **Given** an icon-only button exists (e.g., menu icon), **When** screen reader announces it, **Then** button purpose is clear via aria-label
4. **Given** an image exists, **When** screen reader encounters it, **Then** alt text is provided (or marked as decorative if truly non-content-bearing)
5. **Given** form inputs exist, **When** screen reader encounters them, **Then** labels are programmatically associated (not just visual)
6. **Given** state changes occur (e.g., button disabled, loading state), **When** screen reader checks element, **Then** state change is announced automatically (live region)
7. **Given** error occurs in form, **When** screen reader announces error, **Then** which field and what error is clear; user is directed to fix it

### User Story 3 - Color Contrast and Visual Clarity (Priority: P1)

Users with low vision or color blindness need sufficient color contrast and non-color-dependent visual indicators to read and understand content.

**Why this priority**: Critical for users with color blindness and low vision; required for WCAG Level AA; benefits all users in high-glare environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested with contrast checking tools (WAVE, Lighthouse, Color Contrast Analyzer) verifying minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** text appears on background, **When** contrast ratio is checked, **Then** it meets 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18pt+)
2. **Given** interface uses color to convey meaning (e.g., green=success, red=error), **When** color is removed (grayscale), **Then** meaning is still clear via icon, text, or pattern
3. **Given** user has low vision, **When** they use browser zoom to 200%, **Then** content remains readable without horizontal scrolling
4. **Given** links exist in text, **When** user views page in grayscale, **Then** links are distinguishable from surrounding text (e.g., underline, bold)

---

### User Story 4 - Forms and Validation (Priority: P1)

Users with disabilities need forms to be properly labeled, provide clear validation feedback, and allow recovery from errors.

**Why this priority**: Forms are critical for app; accessible forms prevent user frustration and data loss.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by filling out forms with screen reader and keyboard only, verifying all labels are clear and error messages are helpful.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a form field exists, **When** user encounters it, **Then** field is labeled and label is programmatically connected (not just visual)
2. **Given** form validation fails, **When** user submits, **Then** error message is clear, specific to field(s), and programmatically linked to form fields
3. **Given** user has made an error, **When** they receive error message, **Then** they can correct it and resubmit; original data is preserved
4. **Given** a required field exists, **When** form is announced, **Then** requirement is indicated programmatically (not just visual asterisk)
5. **Given** a complex form exists, **When** user navigates it, **Then** form is grouped logically with fieldsets and legends for context

---

### User Story 5 - Captions and Transcripts (Priority: P2)

Users who are deaf or hard of hearing need video/audio content to be accompanied by captions and transcripts.

**Why this priority**: Essential for deaf/hard of hearing users; required for WCAG Level AA; improves content findability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by watching videos with sound off and verifying captions convey all dialogue and important audio cues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a video contains audio, **When** user watches without sound, **Then** captions are available and include dialogue and important sounds (music change, doorbell ringing)
2. **Given** a video is watched, **When** user prefers to read, **Then** transcript is available with timestamps and speaker identification
3. **Given** video uses audio descriptions for visual content, **When** blind user watches, **Then** audio descriptions explain important visual elements during natural pauses

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user uses browser extensions that modify page layout? (Content remains accessible)
- How are dynamically loaded items handled? (Added items are announced to screen readers immediately)
- What if page uses custom controls (e.g., custom slider)? (Custom controls have ARIA roles, states, and keyboard support)
- How are tooltips handled? (Accessible via keyboard and visible long enough for screen reader users)
