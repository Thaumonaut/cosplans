# Specification Quality Checklist: Resource Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All 6 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1: Costumes & Crew, P2: Equipment, Props, Lifecycle, P3: Locations)
- 40 functional requirements cover all resource types comprehensively
- Constitutional requirements for lifecycle tracking (Section IV) are fully addressed
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios
- Dependencies clearly identify prerequisites (team management, auth, file storage)
- Out of scope section prevents feature creep
