## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach

1. **Phase 1-2**: Complete foundational setup (1-2 days)
2. **Phase 3-5**: Implement P1 user stories (US1, US2, US3, US7, US8) for core MVP (3-4 days)
3. **Phase 6-7**: Add P2 features (US4, US6, US9, US10) for enhanced UX (2-3 days)
4. **Phase 8-9**: Complete P3 features (US5, US11) for compliance (1-2 days)

### Incremental Delivery

Each user story delivers independent value:
- **Week 1**: US1, US2, US3 (basic auth working)
- **Week 2**: US7, US8 (team permissions working)
- **Week 3**: US4, US6, US9, US10 (enhanced features)
- **Week 4**: US5, US11 (compliance features)

### Testing Integration

- Tests written BEFORE implementation for each user story
- Integration tests verify complete user journeys
- E2E tests validate critical authentication flows
- Test dashboard provides development-time observability

### Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ All P1 user stories implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Authentication flows working end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions properly enforced
- ‚úÖ Session management secure and functional
- ‚úÖ Test coverage meets constitutional requirements (70%+)
- ‚úÖ Performance targets met (<100ms auth response, <50ms permission checks)
