## Decision: Bun Runtime Integration

**Decision**: Use Bun runtime exclusively for all development and deployment (constitutional requirement)

**Rationale**:
- **Principle IX Requirement**: Bun runtime is mandatory for all Cosplans development
- **Performance Benefits**: 3x faster package installs, 2x faster dev server vs Node.js
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Ensures consistency across all developer environments
- **Resource Efficiency**: 20% lower memory usage during development

**Implementation Requirements**:
- All `package.json` scripts use `bun run` instead of `npm run`
- Development server runs with `bun --bun run dev`
- Build process uses `bun run build`
- Package management uses `bun install`, `bun add`, `bun remove`

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Node.js - Rejected due to constitutional requirement and performance inferiority
- npm/yarn/pnpm - Rejected as they violate Bun runtime mandate

## Decision: Testing Framework & Observability

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive testing with observability dashboard (constitutional requirement)

**Rationale**:
- **Principle VI Requirement**: Test-driven development with tests written before implementation
- **Principle VI.5 Requirement**: Test dashboard for development-time observability
- **Constitutional Standards**: Minimum 70% code coverage, visual component testing, MSW mocking

**Testing Stack**:
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework (Bun-native, faster than Jest)
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for critical workflows
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking for deterministic testing
- **@testing-library/svelte**: Component testing utilities
- **Test Dashboard (spec 043)**: Development-time test execution and visualization

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Unit tests: Minimum 70% code coverage
- Integration tests: API mocking with MSW for external services
- E2E tests: Critical authentication and authorization workflows
- Visual tests: Component stories for UI verification

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- Tests written before implementation (test-first approach)
- Test dashboard provides real-time execution and coverage visualization
- Component stories enable visual verification without full test execution
- Minimum 70% coverage maintained with warnings for degradation

## Decision: Supabase Auth Integration Pattern

**Decision**: Use Supabase Auth as the primary authentication provider with SvelteKit integration

**Rationale**:
- Supabase provides enterprise-grade authentication with minimal configuration
- Built-in email services eliminate need for external email providers
- Automatic JWT token management and refresh capabilities
- Seamless integration with SvelteKit's SSR capabilities
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation with manual token management - Rejected due to complexity and security risks
- NextAuth.js - Not suitable for SvelteKit architecture
- Auth0/Firebase Auth - Higher cost and complexity for MVP

## Decision: Authentication Flow Architecture

**Decision**: Implement server-side authentication with client-side state management

**Rationale**:
- Server-side route protection prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Client-side auth stores provide reactive UI updates
- Supabase Auth handles session persistence automatically
- Enables proper SSR with authenticated state

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Client-side only authentication - Insufficient for SSR and security requirements
- Pure server-side sessions - More complex state management across client/server

## Decision: Role-Based Access Control Implementation

**Decision**: Database-driven RBAC with Supabase RLS policies

**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL/Supabase RLS provides automatic query-level authorization
- Database-level permissions prevent data leaks even if application layer fails
- Easy to audit and modify permissions through database policies
- Scales well with complex permission hierarchies

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Application-level permission checking - Less secure, potential for data leaks
- JWT-based permissions - Requires more complex token management

## Decision: Password Security Implementation

**Decision**: Argon2 password hashing with Supabase Auth defaults

**Rationale**:
- Argon2 is the current industry standard (winner of Password Hashing Competition)
- Supabase Auth handles secure password hashing automatically
- Provides protection against GPU-based attacks through memory-hard design
- Configurable parameters for future security updates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- bcrypt - Still secure but Argon2 provides better protection against specialized hardware
- scrypt - Similar security but Argon2 has broader adoption

## Decision: Session Management Strategy

**Decision**: HTTP-only cookies with Supabase Auth automatic refresh

**Rationale**:
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks on session tokens
- Automatic token refresh eliminates manual session management
- Supabase handles secure token storage and rotation
- Works seamlessly with SvelteKit's SSR and API routes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- localStorage tokens - Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Custom session management - Unnecessary complexity

## Technical Setup Requirements

### Supabase Project Configuration

1. **Authentication Settings**:
   - Enable email authentication provider
   - Configure email templates for verification and password reset
   - Set session duration to 30 days (as per spec requirements)
   - Enable automatic session refresh

2. **Database Schema**:
   - User profiles table extending Supabase auth.users
   - Roles and permissions tables with proper relationships
   - Audit log table for security tracking
   - RLS policies for all user data tables

3. **Security Policies**:
   - Enable Row Level Security on all user data tables
   - Create policies for role-based data access
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Set up audit logging for all authentication events

### SvelteKit Integration Requirements

1. **Package Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-sveltekit
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Supabase URL and anon key in environment variables
   - Proper CORS configuration for authentication flows

3. **Authentication Hooks**:
   - Server-side auth state initialization
   - Route protection middleware
   - Session refresh handling

## Performance Considerations

- **Authentication Response Time**: Supabase Auth provides sub-100ms response times
- **Permission Checks**: Database-level RLS adds minimal overhead (<10ms per query)
- **Session Validation**: JWT validation is optimized and cached
- **Scale Targets**: Architecture supports 1000+ auth operations per minute

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- HTTPS-only authentication flows (enforced by Supabase)
- Automatic session timeout after 1 hour of inactivity
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Secure password requirements enforcement
- Audit logging for all authentication events
- Protection against email enumeration attacks
