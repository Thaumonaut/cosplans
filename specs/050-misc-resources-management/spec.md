# Miscellaneous Resources Management

## Overview

Comprehensive management system for miscellaneous resources like foam, paints, tools, and other materials used in cosplay construction and prop making.

## User Stories

### User Story 1 - Material Inventory Management (Priority: P1)

Users need to track miscellaneous materials and supplies used in cosplay construction through their complete lifecycle.

**Why this priority**: Essential for managing construction materials; enables proper inventory tracking and cost management for materials.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating material items, updating their status, and verifying state transitions work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add a material, **When** they create it, **Then** they can specify type, quantity, supplier, and initial status
2. **Given** a material exists, **When** viewing the material, **Then** all associated details and usage information are displayed
3. **Given** a material is used up, **When** updating status, **Then** the material lifecycle is properly tracked

### User Story 2 - Material Usage Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users need to track how materials are used across different projects and calculate remaining quantities.

**Why this priority**: Important for project planning; helps manage material consumption and avoid shortages.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by recording material usage, updating quantities, and verifying calculations work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user uses material for a project, **When** recording usage, **Then** the remaining quantity is automatically calculated
2. **Given** material usage is recorded, **When** viewing the material, **Then** usage history and remaining quantity are displayed
3. **Given** material is running low, **When** viewing inventory, **Then** low stock warnings are shown

### User Story 3 - Supplier and Sourcing Management (Priority: P2)

Users need to track suppliers, pricing, and sourcing options for materials.

**Why this priority**: Important for cost management; helps find the best suppliers and track pricing trends.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding supplier information, recording purchases, and verifying the data is properly organized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user purchases material, **When** recording purchase details, **Then** supplier information and pricing are stored
2. **Given** a supplier is used, **When** viewing supplier details, **Then** all materials from that supplier are listed
3. **Given** a user needs material, **When** searching, **Then** suppliers and pricing options are suggested

### User Story 4 - Material Categorization and Organization (Priority: P2)

Users need to organize materials by type, project, or usage to make them easy to find and manage.

**Why this priority**: Important for organization; helps users quickly find materials and understand their inventory.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by categorizing materials, filtering by category, and verifying the organization works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has multiple materials, **When** categorizing them, **Then** materials are organized by type and usage
2. **Given** materials are categorized, **When** filtering by category, **Then** only relevant materials are shown
3. **Given** a user searches for materials, **When** using filters, **Then** search results are properly organized
