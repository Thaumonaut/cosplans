# Specification Quality Checklist: Shoot Transfer Between Teams

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Ready for planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-15

### Clarifications Resolved:
1. **Calendar Events (FR-004)**: User will choose during transfer whether to duplicate or move events
2. **Workflow Stages (FR-008)**: Stages stored as database references, managed separately from shoots

### Quality Assessment:
- All mandatory sections complete and comprehensive
- 4 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P4) and independent test criteria
- 14 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- 6 success criteria with specific, measurable, technology-agnostic metrics
- Comprehensive edge cases identified (7 scenarios)
- Clear assumptions documented including new stage reference architecture

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
