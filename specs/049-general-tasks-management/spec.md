# General Tasks Management

## Overview

Comprehensive task management system for general project tasks that don't fit into specific resource categories (props, costumes, etc.), including communication tasks, research tasks, and miscellaneous project activities.

## User Stories

### User Story 1 - General Task Creation and Management (Priority: P1)

Users need to create and manage general tasks that don't fit into specific resource categories but are important for project completion.

**Why this priority**: Essential for comprehensive project management; covers tasks that don't fit into resource-specific categories.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating general tasks, updating their status, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user needs to create a general task, **When** they create it, **Then** they can specify title, description, priority, and due date
2. **Given** a general task exists, **When** viewing the task, **Then** all associated details and progress are displayed
3. **Given** a general task is completed, **When** marking it complete, **Then** the task status is updated and completion is tracked

### User Story 2 - Communication and Outreach Tasks (Priority: P2)

Users need to track communication tasks like reaching out to suppliers, coordinating with team members, or managing external communications.

**Why this priority**: Important for project coordination; helps manage communication workflows and follow-ups.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating communication tasks, setting reminders, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user needs to contact a supplier, **When** creating a communication task, **Then** they can specify contact details and follow-up requirements
2. **Given** a communication task exists, **When** viewing the task, **Then** contact information and communication history are displayed
3. **Given** a communication task is due, **When** the reminder triggers, **Then** the user is notified with relevant details

### User Story 3 - Research and Planning Tasks (Priority: P2)

Users need to track research tasks like finding references, planning shoots, or investigating new techniques.

**Why this priority**: Important for project planning; helps organize research activities and knowledge gathering.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating research tasks, adding findings, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user needs to research a topic, **When** creating a research task, **Then** they can specify research goals and resources
2. **Given** a research task exists, **When** adding findings, **Then** findings are organized and searchable
3. **Given** research is complete, **When** marking the task complete, **Then** findings are preserved and accessible

### User Story 4 - Administrative and Coordination Tasks (Priority: P2)

Users need to track administrative tasks like scheduling meetings, managing budgets, or coordinating logistics.

**Why this priority**: Important for project administration; helps manage administrative workflows and coordination.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating administrative tasks, setting dependencies, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user needs to schedule a meeting, **When** creating an administrative task, **Then** they can specify participants and scheduling requirements
2. **Given** an administrative task exists, **When** viewing the task, **Then** all relevant details and dependencies are displayed
3. **Given** an administrative task is completed, **When** marking it complete, **Then** dependent tasks are notified
