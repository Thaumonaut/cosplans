# Feature Specification: Mobile App Experience

**Feature Branch**: `036-mobile-app-experience`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Optimized mobile app experience for iOS and Android with native-quality interactions and mobile-specific features

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Touch-Optimized Interface (Priority: P1)

Mobile users need an interface optimized for touch with appropriate tap targets, swipe gestures, and mobile-friendly layouts.

**Why this priority**: Desktop UI doesn't translate to mobile; small buttons and dense layouts cause user frustration and errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using app on actual mobile devices and verifying all interactive elements are tappable (minimum 44x44 px) and usable with one hand.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on mobile device, **When** they view app, **Then** all buttons and interactive elements are at least 44x44 pixels (WCAG minimum)
2. **Given** user is using app one-handed, **When** they reach top and bottom of screen, **Then** controls are positioned for easy thumb access
3. **Given** user performs common gestures (swipe, long-press, pinch), **When** gestures occur, **Then** app responds appropriately
4. **Given** mobile screen is small (320px width), **When** user views content, **Then** layout adapts and doesn't require horizontal scrolling

### User Story 2 - Mobile Navigation (Priority: P1)

Mobile users need optimized navigation patterns like bottom tab bars or hamburger menus that work well with touch input.

**Why this priority**: Desktop navigation doesn't work on mobile; users need quick access to main features without excessive tapping.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating all major sections of app using mobile nav and verifying all features are accessible with < 2 taps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on mobile, **When** they view navigation, **Then** main sections are available via bottom tab bar or accessible hamburger menu
2. **Given** user is in a sub-section, **When** they want to navigate elsewhere, **Then** main navigation is easily accessible without scrolling
3. **Given** user is on mobile, **When** they rotate device to landscape, **Then** navigation and layout adapt appropriately

### User Story 3 - Camera and Photo Library Access (Priority: P1)

Mobile users need direct access to their device's camera and photo library to upload photos directly within the app without leaving it.

**Why this priority**: Core cosplay photography workflow; users need to immediately capture and upload photos from shoots.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to upload photo on mobile device and verifying camera and library options appear and work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user attempts to upload a photo on mobile, **When** they tap upload, **Then** options appear to take photo with camera or choose from photo library
2. **Given** user selects camera option, **When** camera opens, **Then** user can take photo and immediately use it in app
3. **Given** user selects photo from library, **When** app regains focus, **Then** selected photo is ready to use
4. **Given** user takes multiple photos, **When** batch upload is attempted, **Then** multiple photos can be selected and uploaded together

---

### User Story 4 - Push Notifications and Alerts (Priority: P1)

Mobile users need push notifications so they receive alerts even when app is not open, keeping them informed of team activity and deadlines.

**Why this priority**: Push notifications are key mobile engagement tool; users expect to be notified about important events.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering events (mentions, shoot updates) while app is closed and verifying push notification appears on device lock screen.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app is installed on user device, **When** user allows push notifications, **Then** notification permission is requested via system dialog
2. **Given** important event occurs while app is closed, **When** push notification is sent, **Then** notification appears on lock screen within 2 seconds
3. **Given** user taps push notification, **When** app opens, **Then** app navigates directly to the relevant content
4. **Given** user has multiple notifications, **When** they check device, **Then** notifications are grouped or summarized appropriately

---

### User Story 5 - Offline Access and Sync (Priority: P2)

Mobile users need to work offline on their device and have changes automatically sync when connection is restored.

**Why this priority**: Mobile users frequently encounter unreliable connections; offline support prevents data loss and frustration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using app offline, making changes, going online, and verifying changes sync correctly without conflicts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is working offline, **When** they make changes (add note, update checklist), **Then** changes are saved locally
2. **Given** changes were made offline, **When** connection is restored, **Then** changes automatically sync to server
3. **Given** user is offline and views previously cached data, **When** they scroll through data, **Then** cached data is available and usable
4. **Given** user attempts action that requires connection while offline, **When** connection is lost, **Then** user is notified and option to retry is available

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user rotates device during operation? (Layout adapts; state is preserved)
- What if app is closed and reopened? (State is restored; offline changes are synced if connection available)
- How are large files handled on slow mobile connections? (Upload can be paused/resumed; user is warned about data usage)
- What if push notification permission is denied? (User can still use app; notification reminders appear in-app instead)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) MUST be at least 44x44 pixels in size for easy touch interaction
- **FR-002**: Touch targets MUST have sufficient spacing (minimum 8px padding) to prevent accidental taps on adjacent elements
- **FR-003**: App MUST adapt layout to portrait and landscape orientations automatically
- **FR-004**: Responsive design MUST scale properly from 320px (small phones) to 1200px+ (large tablets)
- **FR-005**: Bottom tab bar navigation MUST be used for primary navigation on mobile with 3-5 main sections
- **FR-006**: Hamburger menu MUST be available for secondary navigation; animated toggle MUST work smoothly
- **FR-007**: App MUST provide direct camera access via native camera intent for photo capture
- **FR-008**: App MUST provide photo library access to select existing photos from device storage
- **FR-009**: Batch photo upload MUST be supported for selecting multiple photos at once
- **FR-010**: Push notifications MUST integrate with device notification systems (iOS APNs, Android FCM)
- **FR-011**: Push notification permission request MUST follow platform-specific best practices (iOS timing, Android Pie+ behavior)
- **FR-012**: App MUST include deep linking so push notifications open app to specific content
- **FR-013**: Service Worker or equivalent MUST enable offline access to previously viewed pages and cached data
- **FR-014**: Offline changes MUST be queued and synced when connection is restored with conflict resolution
- **FR-015**: App MUST display current connection status (online/offline) to user
- **FR-016**: Forms MUST be mobile-friendly with large input fields, appropriate keyboards (email for emails, numbers for phone)
- **FR-017**: Long lists MUST implement virtual scrolling or pagination to maintain performance
- **FR-018**: App MUST handle device memory constraints; large lists should lazy load content
- **FR-019**: Toast notifications or snackbars MUST be used for brief feedback messages (not modal alerts unless critical)
- **FR-020**: Home screen icon and app launcher MUST include app icon; splash screen shown during launch

### Key Entities

- **DevicePreference**: User's device-specific settings (orientation preference, notification settings, cache size)
- **OfflineQueue**: Stores user actions (edits, uploads) made while offline for syncing when connection restored
- **MobileMetric**: Tracks mobile-specific metrics (app crashes, startup time, memory usage, battery drain)
