## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-15

### Clarifications Resolved:
1. **Location Permission (FR-009)**: Optional with manual location entry fallback for maximum accessibility
2. **Backdrop Difficulty (FR-015)**: Show all difficulty levels with clear indicators, allowing user self-selection

### Quality Assessment:
- All mandatory sections complete and comprehensive
- 4 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P4) and independent test criteria
- 18 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- 7 success criteria with specific, measurable, technology-agnostic metrics
- Comprehensive edge cases identified (8 scenarios)
- Clear assumptions documented including location handling and difficulty display approach

### Key Design Decisions:
- Location access is optional with manual entry fallback, ensuring feature accessibility for all users
- All difficulty levels shown with clear indicators, maximizing creative inspiration while letting users self-select
- Backdrop suggestions focus on practical DIY options with feasibility considerations
- Location suggestions integrate with existing Google Maps functionality

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
