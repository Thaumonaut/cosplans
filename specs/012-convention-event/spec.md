# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Backdrop and Location Suggestions

**Feature Branch**: `003-generate-backdrop-or`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Generate backdrop or location ideas. I want a feature to use AI to help me come up with backdrops I could make for a certain character or help me find a location that would work well for a certain character"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - AI Backdrop Suggestions for DIY Creation (Priority: P1)

A cosplayer planning a shoot for a specific character (e.g., Spiderman) needs creative backdrop ideas they can build themselves and wants AI to suggest practical DIY backdrops that match the character's aesthetic and story (e.g., "NYC rooftop at night", "alleyway with brick walls and fire escape").

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality enabling cosplayers to overcome creative blocks and get actionable backdrop ideas they can build in their space, which is essential for home or studio shoots.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a character name, receiving 5-10 backdrop suggestions with descriptions and difficulty ratings, and verifying suggestions are relevant to the character's setting and feasible to create.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is planning a shoot with a character assigned (e.g., "Spiderman"), **When** the user selects "Get Backdrop Ideas" from the shoot location section, **Then** the system generates 5-10 creative backdrop suggestions with titles, detailed descriptions, materials needed, and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).

2. **Given** a user receives backdrop suggestions, **When** the user selects one or more suggestions they like, **Then** the system saves the selected backdrop ideas to the shoot with tags for DIY/handmade backdrops.

3. **Given** a user requests backdrop ideas, **When** the AI generation fails or takes longer than expected, **Then** the system displays an error message with retry option and doesn't block other shoot planning activities.

### User Story 2 - Real Location Discovery with Map Integration (Priority: P2)

A cosplayer wants to find actual physical locations near them that would work for their character shoot (e.g., industrial areas for a cyberpunk character, parks for fantasy characters) and wants AI to suggest location types that can then be searched on Google Maps.

**Why this priority**: Real location scouting is important but requires the foundational backdrop suggestion system first, and integrates with existing Google Maps functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by requesting location ideas for a character, receiving location type suggestions (e.g., "abandoned warehouse district", "Japanese garden"), and verifying Google Maps search integration works for finding nearby matches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is planning a shoot and selects "Find Real Locations", **When** the user provides a character and optionally their current location, **Then** the system generates 5-7 location type suggestions with descriptions of why they fit the character.

2. **Given** a user receives location type suggestions, **When** the user selects a suggestion (e.g., "rooftop with city skyline"), **Then** the system opens Google Maps search with that location type query and the user's current location to show nearby options.

3. **Given** a user finds a suitable location via the map search, **When** the user selects a location from the map, **Then** the system saves that location to the shoot with reference to the AI suggestion that led to it.

### User Story 3 - Visual Backdrop Reference Generation (Priority: P3)

A cosplayer wants to visualize backdrop ideas before building them by generating AI reference images of suggested backdrops, helping them understand the aesthetic and plan construction.

**Why this priority**: Visual references enhance the backdrop suggestions but require the base suggestion feature to be working first, and builds on existing AI generation capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by selecting a backdrop suggestion, requesting a visual reference, and verifying an AI-generated image of that backdrop is created and added to shoot references.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has received backdrop suggestions, **When** the user selects "Generate Visual Reference" for a specific backdrop idea, **Then** the system creates an AI-generated image showing what that backdrop might look like.

2. **Given** a visual backdrop reference is generated, **When** the user reviews it, **Then** the system saves it to the shoot's reference gallery tagged with the backdrop description and marked as an AI-generated backdrop reference.

### User Story 4 - Backdrop Building Instructions and Tips (Priority: P4)

A cosplayer who selected a DIY backdrop idea wants step-by-step guidance on how to build it, including materials list, estimated cost, construction steps, and tips for lighting and photography.

**Why this priority**: This adds significant value but is not essential for the MVP since users can research building techniques independently once they have the backdrop idea.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by selecting a saved backdrop idea, requesting building instructions, and verifying detailed guidance is provided with actionable steps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has saved a backdrop idea to their shoot, **When** the user selects "Get Building Guide" for that backdrop, **Then** the system generates detailed instructions including materials list with estimated costs, construction steps, lighting tips, and photography angles.

2. **Given** building instructions are generated, **When** the user reviews them, **Then** the system saves the instructions as a document attached to that backdrop within the shoot for easy reference during construction.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user requests backdrop ideas for an extremely obscure character with no clear canonical setting?
- How does the system handle requests for location types that may not exist in certain geographic areas (e.g., "snowy mountain" in Florida)?
- What happens when generated backdrop suggestions are too complex or expensive for typical cosplayers to build?
- How does the system handle characters that could work with multiple very different backdrop styles (e.g., modern AU vs canonical setting)?
- What happens when a user is planning multiple shoots with different characters and wants to find one backdrop that works for several?
- How does the system handle privacy when accessing user's location for nearby real location searches?
- What happens when Google Maps integration fails or returns no results for a suggested location type?
- How does the system handle backdrop suggestions that might require permits or access to restricted locations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can generate and review backdrop/location suggestions from request to displayed results in under 20 seconds.

- **SC-002**: 85% of generated backdrop suggestions are rated as relevant and feasible by users who request them.

- **SC-003**: Users who use the location suggestion feature successfully find and save a suitable real location within 5 minutes for 70% of requests.

- **SC-004**: Users can generate visual references for backdrop ideas and have them appear in their reference gallery within 40 seconds.

- **SC-005**: Users reuse previously generated backdrop/location suggestions for new shoots 30% of the time, reducing redundant AI generations.

- **SC-006**: Mobile users can successfully generate and save backdrop/location suggestions with the same success rate as desktop users (within 5% variance).

- **SC-007**: 90% of saved backdrop ideas that users mark as "in-progress" or "completed" indicate the suggestions were practical enough to actually build or scout.

## Assumptions

- Backdrop suggestions focus on practical DIY options that typical cosplayers can create with commonly available materials and reasonable effort.
- Location suggestions are general types/categories rather than specific addresses, requiring users to use Google Maps to find actual locations.
- Visual reference generation leverages existing AI image generation capabilities (same system as reference pose generation).
- Building instructions for backdrops are generated using AI with practical guidance, not professional construction documentation.
- Users understand that backdrop/location suggestions are creative starting points and may need adaptation to their specific situation.
- Character context provided by users is sufficient for AI to understand the aesthetic (e.g., character name alone for well-known characters, or brief description for OCs).
- Location permission is optional with manual location entry as fallback, ensuring all users can access the feature regardless of permission choices.
- Google Maps integration uses existing Google Maps functionality in the app without requiring separate API implementation.
- All backdrop difficulty levels are shown with clear indicators, allowing users to choose based on their skill level and available resources.
- The feature is accessible from the shoot detail page's location section where users plan shoot settings.
- Generated suggestions are stored for history/reuse but do not count against AI generation quotas (they're text-based suggestions, not image generation).
- Manual location entry accepts city names, neighborhoods, or general area descriptions for Google Maps searches.
