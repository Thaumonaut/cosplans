# Feature Specification: Internationalization & Localization

**Feature Branch**: `038-internationalization-localization`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Multi-language support, regional formatting, and localization for global cosplay community

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Use App in Preferred Language (Priority: P2)

Users from different countries need the app interface in their preferred language so they can use the app comfortably without language barriers.

**Why this priority**: Enables expansion to global market; users prefer native language interfaces; improves accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing language setting and verifying all UI text updates to selected language without app restart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses language settings, **When** they select a language (e.g., Spanish, French, Japanese), **Then** entire app interface changes to that language
2. **Given** user changes language, **When** app reloads or navigates, **Then** selected language persists across sessions
3. **Given** app supports multiple languages, **When** unsupported language is selected, **Then** app defaults to English or user's system language

### User Story 2 - Regional Date, Time, and Currency Formatting (Priority: P2)

Users need dates, times, numbers, and currencies displayed in their regional format so they understand financial and scheduling information correctly.

**Why this priority**: Prevents confusion about dates (MM/DD vs DD/MM), currency symbols, and decimal separators; critical for budgeting and scheduling.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting device/app locale to different regions and verifying formatting updates appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is in Japan, **When** they view a date, **Then** it displays as YYYY/MM/DD instead of MM/DD/YYYY
2. **Given** user is in Germany, **When** they view a number, **Then** it uses comma as decimal separator (1.234,56) instead of period (1,234.56)
3. **Given** user is in Canada, **When** they view currency, **Then** amounts display in CAD with $ symbol; in UK displays Â£

### User Story 3 - Support for Right-to-Left Languages (Priority: P3)

Users who speak right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew) need the interface layout to mirror appropriately for their language direction.

**Why this priority**: Essential for Arabic and Hebrew users; without this, interface is unusable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting language to Arabic or Hebrew and verifying interface layout mirrors with navigation and text flow reversed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects Arabic or Hebrew, **When** app interface displays, **Then** layout is mirrored: navigation is on right, text flows right-to-left
2. **Given** RTL mode is active, **When** user navigates, **Then** all UI elements including modals, forms, and menus follow RTL conventions

---

### User Story 4 - Timezone Management (Priority: P2)

Users need their events, deadlines, and notifications to be in their local timezone so they don't miss shoots or misunderstand when events occur.

**Why this priority**: Critical for international teams with members in different timezones; prevents scheduling conflicts and missed deadlines.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating event in one timezone, viewing in app set to different timezone, and verifying time adjusts correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user creates a shoot scheduled for 2 PM their timezone, **When** team member in different timezone views it, **Then** shoot displays in their local time (e.g., 11 PM)
2. **Given** user has timezone preference set, **When** they view dates/times, **Then** all times display in their preferred timezone (not server timezone)
3. **Given** user changes timezone, **When** existing events are viewed, **Then** times update to new timezone automatically

---

### User Story 5 - Culturally Appropriate Content and Imagery (Priority: P3)

App should respect cultural differences in imagery, colors, holidays, and messaging to avoid offense or confusion in different markets.

**Why this priority**: Shows respect for different cultures; prevents alienating users in different regions; improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing app in different locales and verifying appropriate imagery and messaging for each region.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app displays default imagery or icons, **When** viewed in different regions, **Then** culturally neutral or region-appropriate imagery is used
2. **Given** app references holidays or dates, **When** viewed in different regions, **Then** culturally significant events are acknowledged appropriately
3. **Given** app uses colors or symbols, **When** reviewed, **Then** no colors/symbols have unintended cultural meanings in target regions

---

### Edge Cases

- What if user's language is not supported? (Default to English or allow selection from available languages)
- What if date/time components (timezone, daylight saving) are ambiguous? (Use unambiguous format; show timezone offset)
- What if user changes timezone frequently (traveling)? (UI can show both local and timezone-adjusted times)

- **FR-005**: Time display MUST respect regional 12-hour vs 24-hour format preference
- **FR-006**: Numbers and currency MUST use locale-appropriate separators and symbols
- **FR-007**: System MUST support Right-to-Left (RTL) layout for Arabic, Hebrew, and other RTL languages
- **FR-008**: App interface MUST mirror completely for RTL languages (navigation, forms, reading order)
- **FR-009**: Timezone MUST be selectable by user and stored in preferences
- **FR-010**: All date/time displays MUST be converted to user's timezone automatically
- **FR-011**: Reminders and notifications MUST trigger at correct local time based on user's timezone
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle daylight saving time transitions correctly

- **TimezonePreference**: User's selected timezone and daylight saving time handling
- **Translation**: Translatable strings mapped to multiple languages and regions
- **LocalizationMetadata**: Metadata about supported languages, regions, and their formatting rules

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: App supports and provides full translations for minimum 10 languages with > 95% coverage of UI strings
- **SC-002**: Users can change language and see interface update within 1 second
- **SC-003**: Date, time, number, and currency formatting is correct for selected region (tested against locale standards)
- **SC-004**: RTL languages display correctly with proper layout mirroring; no text layout issues
- **SC-005**: Team members in different timezones can schedule shoots correctly with 100% accuracy

- **SC-007**: International users report 90%+ satisfaction with localization quality in user testing

## Assumptions

- Professional human translations are used for supported languages (not machine-translated)
- Locale data (date/time/number formats, timezones) comes from standard libraries (CLDR, ICU)
- Timezone database is maintained and updated with daylight saving time changes
- Right-to-left support is implemented using CSS logical properties or similar approaches
- Currency exchange rates are obtained from reliable data source
- Translation management system is implemented (e.g., i18n library with external translation files)

## Dependencies

- Calendar System (032-calendar-system) - timezone-aware event management
- Notification System (031-notification-system) - localized notifications
- All features - all UI strings must be localizable
