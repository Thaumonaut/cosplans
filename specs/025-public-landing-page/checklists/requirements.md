# Specification Quality Checklist: Public Landing Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Feature**: [025-public-landing-page spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **3 clarifications remain**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Clarifications Needed**:
1. Brand colors and design system (what palette to use?)
2. Logo and branding assets location (where are brand files?)
3. Hero image/video content (screenshot, video, illustration, or custom design?)

These are content/design decisions that don't block technical planning - can proceed with placeholders and fill in design later. Ready for planning with design TBD.
