# Feature Specification: Performance & Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `035-performance-optimization`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: System-wide performance optimization ensuring fast load times, smooth interactions, and efficient resource usage

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Fast Initial Page Load (Priority: P1)

Users need the app to load quickly regardless of device or network speed so they can start working immediately.

**Why this priority**: Directly impacts user satisfaction and retention; 47% of users abandon sites that take >3 seconds to load.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring page load time on various network speeds (3G, 4G, WiFi) and verifying target achieved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses app on 4G connection, **When** page loads, **Then** interactive elements appear within 1.5 seconds
2. **Given** user accesses app on 3G connection, **When** page loads, **Then** interactive elements appear within 3 seconds
3. **Given** user accesses app on WiFi, **When** page loads, **Then** interactive elements appear within 1 second

### User Story 2 - Smooth Interactions and Animations (Priority: P1)

Users need the app to feel responsive and fast when clicking buttons, scrolling, or navigating between pages with smooth 60 FPS animations.

**Why this priority**: Creates sense of app responsiveness and fluidity; poor performance creates sense of app being broken or slow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring frame rate during interactions and verifying 60 FPS is maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user scrolls a long list, **When** scrolling occurs, **Then** frame rate stays at 60 FPS without stuttering
2. **Given** user clicks button, **When** interaction completes, **Then** response occurs within 100ms
3. **Given** user navigates between pages, **When** navigation occurs, **Then** transition is smooth with no janky animations

### User Story 3 - Efficient Data Loading (Priority: P2)

Users need the app to load only necessary data and display results quickly, even with large datasets.

**Why this priority**: Prevents long loading times when working with large shoots, photo collections, or team rosters.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading pages with 1000+ items and verifying load time and responsiveness remain good.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has 1000+ photos in an album, **When** they view album, **Then** page loads within 2 seconds (showing first batch)
2. **Given** user scrolls to bottom of large list, **When** more items are requested, **Then** additional items load within 1 second
3. **Given** user searches through large dataset, **When** search completes, **Then** results return within 2 seconds

---

### User Story 4 - Efficient Resource Usage (Priority: P2)

Users need the app to use minimal memory, battery, and data so it doesn't drain their device or use up data plans.

**Why this priority**: Mobile users on limited data plans or low-end devices need the app to be lean.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by monitoring memory usage, battery drain, and data consumption during normal usage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app is running, **When** user performs normal operations, **Then** memory usage stays under 50MB on low-end devices
2. **Given** user has app running for 1 hour, **When** battery is measured, **Then** battery drain is < 10% on typical device
3. **Given** user uploads 10 photos, **When** data usage is measured, **Then** total data used (including optimization) is < 15MB

---

### User Story 5 - Cache and Offline Support (Priority: P2)

Users need content to be cached so it loads instantly when revisited, and some functionality to work offline.

**Why this priority**: Enables fast repeat access and provides value even when connection is temporarily lost.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading page, going offline, attempting to access cached content and offline features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has visited a page before, **When** they visit again, **Then** page loads from cache in < 500ms on repeat visits
2. **Given** user goes offline, **When** they access previously viewed content, **Then** cached version is displayed
3. **Given** user is offline and attempts action requiring connection, **When** action is queued, **Then** it executes when connection resumes

### Edge Cases

- What happens on very slow networks (2G)? (Graceful degradation; lower quality assets loaded; user can choose to load full quality)
- What if user has very limited device storage? (Ability to clear cache; lazy load assets)
- What if server is under heavy load? (Response times degrade gracefully; queuing or load shedding occurs)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Initial page load MUST complete within 1.5 seconds on 4G connections and 3 seconds on 3G connections (as measured by real user monitoring)
- **FR-002**: All interactive elements MUST respond to user input within 100ms
- **FR-003**: Scroll and animations MUST maintain 60 FPS frame rate on devices with 4GB+ RAM
- **FR-004**: Images MUST be automatically optimized (compressed, scaled) before delivery; original resolution not sent unless requested
- **FR-005**: Code splitting MUST be implemented so only necessary JavaScript/CSS is loaded for current page (not entire app)
- **FR-006**: Assets MUST be cached in browser with appropriate cache headers (1 year for versioned assets, short for dynamic content)
- **FR-007**: Third-party scripts and fonts MUST be lazy loaded or asynchronously loaded to not block page rendering
- **FR-008**: Database queries MUST be optimized with indexes; query response time targets < 100ms for typical queries
- **FR-009**: API responses MUST be paginated with sensible defaults (e.g., 20-50 items per page)
- **FR-010**: Infinite scroll or pagination MUST be implemented to avoid loading all items at once
- **FR-011**: Memory usage on client MUST not exceed 100MB during normal operation on devices with 4GB+ RAM
- **FR-012**: App MUST preload critical assets (fonts, first screen JavaScript/CSS) using resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- **FR-013**: Service Worker MUST be implemented for offline support and asset caching
- **FR-014**: Bundle size MUST not exceed 100KB (gzipped) for main JavaScript bundle
- **FR-015**: Critical CSS MUST be inlined in HTML document; non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
- **FR-016**: API MUST support conditional requests (if-modified-since, ETags) to avoid unnecessary data transfer
- **FR-017**: System MUST implement request rate limiting and request prioritization to handle traffic spikes
- **FR-018**: Database connection pooling MUST be used to minimize connection overhead

### Key Entities

- **PerformanceMetric**: Tracked metrics including page load time, API response time, frame rate, memory usage
- **CachePolicy**: Configuration for caching strategy per asset type (images, CSS, JavaScript, API responses)
- **PerformanceAlert**: Alerts when performance metrics exceed thresholds

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Core Web Vitals metrics meet Google standards: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **SC-002**: Initial page load time averages < 1.5s on 4G, < 3s on 3G (measured via synthetic monitoring)
- **SC-003**: Repeat page loads average < 500ms due to caching
- **SC-004**: 95th percentile API response time is < 200ms under normal load
- **SC-005**: Frame rate stays at 60 FPS during scroll and interactions for 99% of user sessions
- **SC-006**: Mobile app bundle size is < 100MB (uncompressed)
- **SC-007**: Users report improved satisfaction with app speed (90%+ satisfied with responsiveness)
- **SC-008**: Battery drain on mobile is < 10% per hour of normal usage

## Assumptions

- Performance is measured using Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring tools
- Target devices include modern smartphones, tablets, and desktops; older devices may have reduced performance
- Network conditions tested include WiFi, 4G LTE, and 3G; 2G support is not a requirement but should degrade gracefully
- CDN is used for asset delivery with geographic distribution
- Server infrastructure supports auto-scaling to handle load spikes

## Dependencies

- All features must be built with performance requirements in mind
- Photo Management (023-photo-management-storage) - image optimization
- Design system components - component performance optimization
