## Clarifications

### Session: 2025-10-16

**Q1: Navigation Items Definition**  
**Answer**: Navigation structure organized as follows:
- **Team Switcher** (dropdown at top)
- **Main Section**: Dashboard, Calendar, Gallery, Tasks, Messages, Community Profile
- **Resources Section**: Characters/Costumes, Props, Crew, Locations, Equipment, Budgeting
- **Settings Section** (at bottom): User Account, Team Settings, Other Settings
- **Header Actions** (persistent): Theme Toggle, Quick Options (Sign Out, etc.)

**Impact**: Defines exact navigation hierarchy with 3 main sections (Main, Resources, Settings) plus team switcher and header actions. Total of 12 main navigation items plus settings group.

**Q2: Icon Set Selection**  
**Answer**: Lucide Icons (lucide-svelte package)

**Impact**: Tree-shakeable modern icon library compatible with shadcn/svelte stack. Consistent 2px stroke width, ~1KB per icon. Provides all needed icons: Home, Calendar, Image, CheckSquare, MessageSquare, User, Shirt, Box, Users, MapPin, Wrench, DollarSign, Settings, Sun/Moon, LogOut, etc.

**Q3: Theme Toggle Behavior**  
**Answer**: Dropdown menu with multiple theme style options - different variants of light and dark themes with different color schemes, plus a "Custom Theme" option

**Impact**: Requires theme system with multiple variants (e.g., "Light Default", "Light Warm", "Light Cool", "Dark Default", "Dark Purple", "Dark Blue", etc.). Dropdown in header shows current theme icon/name, expands to show all options with preview swatches. Stores theme preference in localStorage/user profile. Custom theme option will link to theme customization interface (may require separate spec for theme builder/editor feature).

**Q4: Mobile Sidebar Behavior**  
**Answer**: Overlay pattern - sidebar slides over content with dimmed backdrop, closes on backdrop click

**Impact**: Sidebar will use fixed positioning on mobile with z-index above content. Semi-transparent backdrop (rgba black/white ~40% opacity) dims content when sidebar open. Closes via backdrop click, swipe-left gesture, or navigation. Focus trap active when open. No content reflow needed = better performance.

**Q5: Team Switcher Interaction**  
**Answer**: Smart redirect (stay on same route if valid for new team, otherwise redirect to dashboard) + confirmation modal on pages with forms/unsaved changes

**Impact**: Team switch logic must check: 1) Does current route exist/have permissions for new team? If yes, stay and reload data. If no, redirect to dashboard. 2) Before switching, check for unsaved form changes (e.g., on details/edit pages). If found, show confirmation modal: "You have unsaved changes. Switch teams anyway?" with Cancel/Switch buttons. Requires form dirty state tracking across the app.

**Q6: Archive Section (Post-Session Addition)**  
**Answer**: Add "Archive" section in Resources group for accessing previous/completed shoots

**Impact**: Navigation structure updated to include Archive as 7th Resources item. Total navigation items: 18 (Main: 6, Resources: 7, Settings: 3, Header Actions: 2+). Archive page will show historical shoots with filters for date ranges, team members, events.

**Q7: Routing Implementation (Post-Session Addition)**  
**Answer**: Use SvelteKit's built-in file-based router exclusively (no third-party routing libraries)

**Impact**: Navigation will use native SvelteKit APIs: `goto()` for programmatic navigation, `beforeNavigate()` for unsaved changes guard, `afterNavigate()` for active state updates, `$page` store for current route. Ensures optimal performance with zero-overhead routing, automatic code splitting, and built-in preloading. No additional routing dependencies needed.

**Route Structure**: Sidebar navigation supports both authenticated routes (dashboard, calendar, gallery, etc.) and public routes. Public routes (landing page, about, help, contact, features) are accessible without authentication but are NOT included in the sidebar navigation (sidebar only appears for authenticated users). Public pages use separate layout without sidebar.

## Success Criteria

1. **Navigation Completeness**: All main app features (Dashboard, Shoots, Team, Gallery, Calendar, etc.) are accessible from sidebar within 2 clicks
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Current page is immediately distinguishable from inactive pages (â‰¥30 point difference in contrast or background color)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Sidebar adapts to all screen sizes without horizontal scroll or content overlap
4. **Team Context**: Team name, avatar, and user info are visible at top and bottom of sidebar respectively
5. **Real-time Updates**: Notification badges update within 1 second of event trigger
6. **Keyboard Navigation**: All sidebar items are accessible and navigable using keyboard only
7. **Performance**: Initial load time <100ms, team switch <500ms
8. **Notifications**: Unread count badges appear on: Messages, Notifications, Tasks (context-dependent)

## Key Entities

### NavigationItem
```typescript
interface NavigationItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  href: string;
  icon: string; // icon name or SVG path
  group: 'main' | 'resources' | 'settings' | 'header-actions';
  badge?: {
    count: number;
    type: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
  };
  requiresPermission?: string;
  isCollapsible?: boolean;
  children?: NavigationItem[];
}

// Specific navigation items (12 main + 3 settings + 2+ header actions):
// Main: Dashboard, Calendar, Gallery, Tasks, Messages, Community Profile
// Resources: Characters/Costumes, Props, Crew, Locations, Equipment, Budgeting, Archive
// Settings: User Account, Team Settings, Other Settings
// Header Actions: Theme Toggle, Sign Out
```

### SidebarState
```typescript
interface SidebarState {
  isCollapsed: boolean;
  isOpen: boolean; // mobile toggle
  activeItem: string; // current page id
  team: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    avatarUrl?: string;
  };
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    avatarUrl?: string;
  };
  notifications: Record<string, number>; // item id -> unread count
}
```

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Very Long Team Names**: Names >30 chars should truncate with ellipsis and full text in tooltip
2. **Many Teams**: If user is in 50+ teams, team switcher should paginate or search
3. **Deep Navigation**: If navigation item has children (3+ levels), only show 2 levels and link to parent page
4. **Permission Restrictions**: Navigation items should be hidden (not disabled) if user lacks permission
5. **Network Offline**: Sidebar must remain accessible; navigation items that require network should show disabled state
6. **Very Small Screens**: On screens <320px (phones in landscape), sidebar may need further optimization

## Acceptance Scenarios

### Given: User is logged in and on Dashboard page
**When**: User clicks "Team Settings" in sidebar
**Then**:
- Page navigates to Team Settings
- "Team Settings" item in sidebar becomes highlighted
- URL changes to /team/settings
- Breadcrumb updates (if applicable)

### Given: User has 3 unread messages
**When**: User clicks on any page (not Messages page)
**Then**:
- "Messages" sidebar item shows badge with count "3"
- Badge is red/urgent color
- Clicking Messages navigates to Messages page
- Badge disappears after all messages are marked read

### Given: User is on mobile device
**When**: Page loads
**Then**:
- Sidebar is collapsed to icon-only view
- Hamburger menu icon is visible
- Clicking hamburger expands sidebar as overlay
- Clicking outside sidebar or on a link closes it

### Given: User has permission to access Admin Dashboard
**When**: User views sidebar
**Then**:
- "Admin" section is visible at bottom of sidebar
- Admin items are only visible to users with admin_access permission

### Given: User switches teams
**When**: User opens team switcher and selects different team
**Then**:
- Team name/logo at top of sidebar updates
- Dashboard data refreshes to show new team's content
- Navigation items adjust based on new team's features
- No full page refresh occurs

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On**:
- 020-user-authentication (user context required)
- 021-shoots-teams-creation (team context required)
- 022-permissions-access-control (permission-based visibility)
- 031-notification-system (notification badges)

**Required By**:
- All main app features (001-001-039) - navigation is foundational

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: SvelteKit file-based router (built-in, no third-party libraries)
- **Navigation APIs**: `goto()`, `beforeNavigate()`, `afterNavigate()`, `$page` store
- **State Management**: Svelte stores (sidebar state, notifications)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for notification updates
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons (lucide-svelte) - tree-shakeable, 2px stroke, ~1KB per icon
- **Animation**: CSS transitions (smooth collapse/expand)

---

## Assumptions & Constraints

1. User is already authenticated (handled by spec 020)
2. Team context is established before rendering sidebar
3. Navigation structure is relatively stable (not adding items dynamically often)
4. Notification system is implemented (spec 031)
5. Permissions system is in place (spec 022)
6. Maximum of 8-12 top-level navigation items (more would require reorganization)

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use sticky positioning for sidebar on desktop (easier than fixed for content reflow)
- Use fixed positioning with overlay on mobile (<768px breakpoint)
- Use Svelte stores for sidebar state to allow updates from any component
- Navigation sections: Main (6 items), Resources (7 items including Archive), Settings (3 items)
- Lazy load team avatars using IntersectionObserver
- Use keyboard event listeners for arrow key navigation
- Install lucide-svelte package for icons (tree-shakeable)
- Implement theme dropdown with multiple light/dark variants + custom theme option
- Track form dirty state globally for team switch confirmation
- Team switch: check route permissions â†’ stay if valid â†’ dashboard if not â†’ confirm if unsaved changes
- Mobile: overlay with backdrop, swipe-left to close, focus trap when open
- Use SvelteKit's native routing APIs exclusively: `goto()` for navigation, `beforeNavigate()` for guards, `$page` for active route
- No third-party routing libraries needed - file-based routing provides optimal performance
