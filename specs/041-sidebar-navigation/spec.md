# Specification 041: Sidebar Navigation & App Layout

**Feature**: Persistent sidebar navigation for main application with collapsible menu, team switcher, and visual hierarchy.

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ SPECIFICATION (Not yet implemented)

---

## Overview

The Cosplans application needs a professional sidebar navigation system that provides persistent access to key features, team context, and user information. This navigation should support the growing feature set while maintaining clear information hierarchy and mobile responsiveness.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Scenario 1: Team Lead Navigation
**User**: Alex (team lead planning a cosplay shoot)
**When**: Alex logs in to start planning for the weekend convention
**Then**: 
- Sidebar is immediately visible with team name and member avatars
- Can quickly navigate to Dashboard, Shoots, Team, Gear without scrolling
- Active page is highlighted to show current location
- Can switch teams via dropdown without full page navigation

**Why**: Team leads need quick context awareness and fast navigation between frequently used features

**Testing**:
- [ ] Sidebar visible on page load
- [ ] Current page highlighted
- [ ] Team switcher loads other teams instantly
- [ ] Navigation items have appropriate icons

### Scenario 2: Mobile User Navigation
**User**: Jordan (photographer taking photos at a shoot)
**When**: Jordan is on mobile checking shoot status during the event
**Then**:
- Sidebar collapses to icon-only on mobile
- Hamburger menu available to expand sidebar
- Easy one-handed navigation in portrait mode
- Quick access to critical features (Shoots, Gallery, Messages)

**Why**: Mobile users need functional navigation without sacrificing screen space for content

**Testing**:
- [ ] Sidebar collapses on mobile breakpoint
- [ ] Hamburger menu toggles sidebar visibility
- [ ] Content reflows properly when sidebar visible
- [ ] Touch targets are adequate (44px minimum)

### Scenario 3: Feature Discovery
**User**: Sam (new team member)
**When**: Sam explores the application for the first time
**Then**:
- All available features are visible in sidebar
- Features are grouped logically (Planning, Content, Team, Settings)
- Icons help identify features quickly

- [ ] Count updates in real-time
- [ ] Badge clears when items read
- [ ] Navigation works correctly

## Success Criteria

1. **Navigation Completeness**: All main app features (Dashboard, Shoots, Team, Gallery, Calendar, etc.) are accessible from sidebar within 2 clicks
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Current page is immediately distinguishable from inactive pages (â‰¥30 point difference in contrast or background color)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Sidebar adapts to all screen sizes without horizontal scroll or content overlap
4. **Team Context**: Team name, avatar, and user info are visible at top and bottom of sidebar respectively
5. **Real-time Updates**: Notification badges update within 1 second of event trigger
6. **Keyboard Navigation**: All sidebar items are accessible and navigable using keyboard only
7. **Performance**: Initial load time <100ms, team switch <500ms
8. **Notifications**: Unread count badges appear on: Messages, Notifications, Tasks (context-dependent)

## Key Entities

### NavigationItem
```typescript
interface NavigationItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  href: string;
  icon: string; // icon name or SVG path
  group: 'planning' | 'content' | 'team' | 'settings' | 'admin';
  badge?: {
    count: number;
    type: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
  };
  requiresPermission?: string;
  isCollapsible?: boolean;
  children?: NavigationItem[];
}
```

### SidebarState
```typescript
interface SidebarState {
  isCollapsed: boolean;
  isOpen: boolean; // mobile toggle
  activeItem: string; // current page id
  team: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    avatarUrl?: string;
  };
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    avatarUrl?: string;
  };
  notifications: Record<string, number>; // item id -> unread count
}
```

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Very Long Team Names**: Names >30 chars should truncate with ellipsis and full text in tooltip
2. **Many Teams**: If user is in 50+ teams, team switcher should paginate or search
3. **Deep Navigation**: If navigation item has children (3+ levels), only show 2 levels and link to parent page
4. **Permission Restrictions**: Navigation items should be hidden (not disabled) if user lacks permission
5. **Network Offline**: Sidebar must remain accessible; navigation items that require network should show disabled state
6. **Very Small Screens**: On screens <320px (phones in landscape), sidebar may need further optimization

## Acceptance Scenarios

### Given: User is logged in and on Dashboard page
**When**: User clicks "Team Settings" in sidebar
**Then**:
- Page navigates to Team Settings
- "Team Settings" item in sidebar becomes highlighted
- URL changes to /team/settings
- Breadcrumb updates (if applicable)

### Given: User has 3 unread messages
**When**: User clicks on any page (not Messages page)
**Then**:
- "Messages" sidebar item shows badge with count "3"
- Badge is red/urgent color
- Clicking Messages navigates to Messages page
- Badge disappears after all messages are marked read

### Given: User is on mobile device
**When**: Page loads
**Then**:
- Sidebar is collapsed to icon-only view
- Hamburger menu icon is visible
- Clicking hamburger expands sidebar as overlay
- Clicking outside sidebar or on a link closes it

### Given: User has permission to access Admin Dashboard
**When**: User views sidebar
**Then**:
- "Admin" section is visible at bottom of sidebar
- Admin items are only visible to users with admin_access permission

### Given: User switches teams
**When**: User opens team switcher and selects different team
**Then**:
- Team name/logo at top of sidebar updates
- Dashboard data refreshes to show new team's content
- Navigation items adjust based on new team's features
- No full page refresh occurs

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On**:
- 020-user-authentication (user context required)
- 021-shoots-teams-creation (team context required)
- 022-permissions-access-control (permission-based visibility)
- 031-notification-system (notification badges)

**Required By**:
- All main app features (001-001-039) - navigation is foundational

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Svelte stores (sidebar state, notifications)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for notification updates
- **Icons**: Heroicons or similar consistent icon set
- **Animation**: CSS transitions (smooth collapse/expand)

---

## Assumptions & Constraints

1. User is already authenticated (handled by spec 020)
2. Team context is established before rendering sidebar
3. Navigation structure is relatively stable (not adding items dynamically often)
4. Notification system is implemented (spec 031)
5. Permissions system is in place (spec 022)
6. Maximum of 8-12 top-level navigation items (more would require reorganization)

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use sticky positioning for sidebar (easier than fixed for content reflow)
- Implement responsive breakpoint at 768px for mobile adaptation
- Use Svelte stores for sidebar state to allow updates from any component
- Consider collapsible sections (Planning, Content, etc.) if navigation grows beyond 12 items
- Lazy load team avatars using IntersectionObserver
- Use keyboard event listeners for arrow key navigation
