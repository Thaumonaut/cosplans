# Feature Specification: Backend Service Reliability & Error Transparency

**Feature Branch**: `042-setup-and-connect`  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "setup and connect to backend services and create tests to check for edge cases. I also want good error handling that will let me know exactly what issues are happening through the server with user friendly messages on the frontend"

## Overview

The feature ensures Cosplans connects to its backend services in a reliable, observable, and well-tested manner. Teams need high confidence that data flows between the client experience and shared services without hidden failures. Explicit goals include:

- Establishing consistent service connections with environment-aware configuration and health indicators
- Covering edge-case behaviours through automated tests that can be run on demand and in CI
- Delivering human-friendly error messages for end-users while surfacing precise diagnostics for operators

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17

- Q: How frequently should automated health checks run once connections are active? → A: Every 5 minutes

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Configure and Validate Service Connections (Priority: P1)

Operations lead configures Cosplans' backend integration and verifies the connection works before enabling it for the team.

**Why this priority**: No downstream workflow can rely on the platform until services are connected and validated.

**Independent Test**: Load the configuration panel, enter credentials, and run connection tests. Success enables data sync; failure halts rollout with actionable guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid credentials are supplied, **When** the lead runs "Test Connection", **Then** the system confirms connection, shows last-checked timestamp, and allows activation.
2. **Given** credentials are invalid or endpoint unreachable, **When** the lead runs "Test Connection", **Then** the system blocks activation and displays the precise failure reason with remediation tips.
3. **Given** environment context changes (e.g., switching from staging to production), **When** the lead updates the selected environment, **Then** the system reloads environment-specific defaults and requires retesting before activation.

### User Story 2 - Automated Edge-Case Diagnostics (Priority: P1)

QA specialist triggers automated diagnostics that exercise critical edge cases (timeouts, malformed payloads, permission denials) to confirm resilience before deploy.

**Why this priority**: Catching integration regressions early prevents broken releases and protects production reliability.

**Independent Test**: Run diagnostic suite and review results without deploying code. Pass/fail outcomes determine release readiness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the diagnostics suite is initiated, **When** edge-case simulations complete, **Then** the system shows pass/fail status per scenario with timestamps and evidence links.
2. **Given** any diagnostic fails, **When** results are presented, **Then** the system highlights blocking issues, records them for audit, and prevents release approval until resolved.
3. **Given** diagnostics are scheduled before release windows, **When** the suite completes, **Then** stakeholders receive summary notifications showing overall status and any required follow-up actions.

### User Story 3 - Surface Friendly Frontend Errors with Operator Detail (Priority: P2)

Team members encounter an error while working in Cosplans and need clear guidance, while operators require precise diagnostics to act.

**Why this priority**: Maintains trust and productivity by preventing cryptic failures and enabling rapid incident response.

**Independent Test**: Simulate API failure and verify frontend message, support link, and back-office diagnostics without inspecting code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a backend request returns a known error state, **When** a user encounters it, **Then** they see a plain-language explanation and next-step options (retry, contact support) without exposing system jargon.
2. **Given** the same error is logged, **When** operators review system diagnostics, **Then** they can see correlation IDs, affected users, and stack-level detail to troubleshoot.
3. **Given** the issue recurs across multiple users, **When** thresholds are exceeded, **Then** the system escalates with alerts containing aggregated counts and impact assessment.

### User Story 4 - Monitor Ongoing Service Health (Priority: P3)

Operations analyst reviews live health indicators to ensure service connections remain healthy after launch.

**Why this priority**: Continuous monitoring prevents silent failures and keeps stakeholders confident in data integrity.

**Independent Test**: Access monitoring view, verify heartbeat status, and acknowledge alerts independently from configuration workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** service connections are active, **When** the analyst opens the health view, **Then** they see uptime percentage, last successful check timestamp, and any current incidents.
2. **Given** a health check fails twice consecutively, **When** thresholds trigger, **Then** the analyst receives alert notifications with contextual guidance and can mark mitigation in progress.
3. **Given** an incident is resolved, **When** the analyst acknowledges it, **Then** the system logs resolution details and resets status indicators to green.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when stored credentials expire mid-session? System must detect expiry, gracefully fail requests, and prompt operations to refresh credentials without losing queued actions.
- How does the system handle partial service outages (e.g., degraded latency but not full failure)? System must downgrade features reliant on affected services and communicate degraded status to users.
- What if automated diagnostics cannot reach sandbox data due to maintenance? System must skip dependent tests, label them as "blocked", and notify responsible owners for rescheduling.
- How are concurrent configuration edits handled? System must serialize or lock edits, preventing conflicting updates and informing later editors of active sessions.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The platform MUST provide a guided configuration flow that captures environment selection, credentials, and connection endpoints before activation.
- **FR-002**: The platform MUST validate configuration inputs in real time and block activation until a successful connection test completes.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST offer an automated diagnostics suite covering latency spikes, malformed data responses, permission denials, and upstream outages.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST record diagnostic results with pass/fail status, execution time, and evidence links for at least 90 days.
- **FR-005**: The platform MUST translate backend error states into user-friendly frontend messages with actionable next steps and without exposing sensitive technical details.
- **FR-006**: The platform MUST attach correlation identifiers to each request and surface them in operator-facing logs and notifications.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide real-time health indicators (uptime, last check time, incident history) accessible to authorized operations roles with automated health checks running at least every 5 minutes.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST send proactive alerts when connectivity or diagnostics fall below defined thresholds (e.g., two consecutive failures, response time exceeding SLA).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Service Connection Profile**: Captures environment (development/staging/production), credential metadata (owner, expiry date), endpoints, and activation status. Linked to health history and diagnostic runs.
- **Diagnostic Test Run**: Records the execution of automated scenarios including inputs used, expected behaviour, actual outcome, duration, and resulting status.
- **Error Event**: Represents a backend failure encountered by a user, storing user context, correlation ID, categorized error code, frontend message shown, and resolution status.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of service configurations pass a connection test before activation, with validation completing in under 30 seconds.
- **SC-002**: Automated diagnostics cover at least 90% of identified critical edge cases and complete within 10 minutes per run.
- **SC-003**: 95% of user-facing error messages are rated "clear" or better in post-incident surveys and include actionable next steps.
- **SC-004**: Mean time to detect service disruptions decreases by 50% compared to the current baseline, as measured over a 30-day post-launch window.

## Assumptions

- Existing backend services expose health endpoints or equivalent signals that can be consumed for monitoring.
- Operations and QA roles have permissions to configure connections, run diagnostics, and view sensitive error details.
- Incident communication channels (email, in-app notifications) already exist and can deliver alerts produced by this feature.
