# Implementation Plan: Backend Service Reliability & Error Transparency

**Branch**: `042-setup-and-connect` | **Date**: October 17, 2025 | **Spec**: [/specs/042-setup-and-connect/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/042-setup-and-connect/spec.md`

## Summary

Deliver a reliability layer that keeps Cosplans' Supabase-backed services connected, observable, and safe to operate. We will implement environment-aware configuration with connection testing, an automated diagnostics harness for critical edge cases, structured error translation for frontend messaging, and continuous health monitoring with five-minute heartbeat checks. The approach relies on Supabase Postgres, SvelteKit server routes, and Bun-based tooling, aligning with constitution mandates on Bun runtime and test-first development.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (SvelteKit) running on Bun 1.3.x runtime  
**Primary Dependencies**: SvelteKit, @supabase/supabase-js, Tailwind CSS with theme variables, shadcn/svelte, Yjs, @casl/ability  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Storage buckets for diagnostics evidence  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), MSW for API mocking, bun test runner integration  
**Target Platform**: SvelteKit web application deployed on Bun-compatible hosting (Linux)  
**Project Type**: Web application with real-time collaboration  
**Performance Goals**: Connection test completes <30 seconds; diagnostics suite finishes ≤10 minutes; incident detection leads to 50% faster mean time to detect disruptions  
**Constraints**: Automated health checks every 5 minutes; graceful degradation for partial outages; user-facing errors must provide actionable guidance  
**Scale/Scope**: Initial release supports multi-team orgs (dozens of concurrent users per team) with expansion to hundreds of service connections across environments

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Principle I (Web-first responsive SvelteKit): ✔ Feature enhances backend reliability for the existing web app without platform divergence.
- Principle II (Real-time collaboration): ✔ Health monitoring and diagnostics ensure realtime sync remains trustworthy.
- Principle VI (Test-driven development): ✔ Plan mandates diagnostics and automated tests before rollout.
- Principle IX (Bun runtime mandate): ✔ All tooling and scripts remain Bun-native.

No constitutional violations identified.

*Post-Design Recheck (Phase 1 complete):* All principles remain satisfied; new diagnostics tooling continues to leverage Bun, preserves realtime collaboration integrity, and keeps test-first workflow intact.
