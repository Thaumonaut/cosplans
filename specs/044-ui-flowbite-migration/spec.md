# Feature Specification: UI Library Migration to Flowbite Svelte

**Feature Branch**: `044-ui-flowbite-migration`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Input**: User description: "Migrate UI library from shadcn-svelte to Flowbite Svelte and create reusable themed components to reduce code duplication and ensure consistent styling across the application"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### Developer Story 1 - Create Reusable Themed Components (Priority: P1)

Developers need a set of reusable UI components that automatically use theme variables to ensure consistent styling across the application without repeating inline styles.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all other work - without reusable components, we cannot reduce code duplication

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating ThemedCard, ThemedInput, ThemedButton components and verifying they render with correct theme variables in both light and dark modes

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs a card container, **When** they use `<ThemedCard title="Test">`, **Then** the card renders with theme background, border, and text colors
2. **Given** a developer needs an input field, **When** they use `<ThemedInput name="test" />`, **Then** the input renders with theme colors and supports all standard HTML input events
3. **Given** a developer needs a button, **When** they use `<ThemedButton variant="primary">`, **Then** the button renders with theme accent color and supports click events

---

### Developer Story 2 - Migrate Flowbite Svelte Library (Priority: P1)

Developers need access to Flowbite Svelte components for complex UI patterns (modals, dropdowns, tables) that are too complex to build from scratch.

**Why this priority**: Enables use of production-ready components and replaces incompatible shadcn-svelte

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing Flowbite Svelte, configuring Tailwind, and importing a Flowbite component successfully

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Flowbite Svelte is installed, **When** developer imports `{ Modal } from 'flowbite-svelte'`, **Then** the import succeeds without errors
2. **Given** Tailwind is configured with Flowbite plugin, **When** developer uses Flowbite components, **Then** components render with correct Flowbite styles

---

### Developer Story 3 - Refactor Existing Pages (Priority: P2)

Developers need existing pages refactored to use new reusable components to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

**Why this priority**: Delivers the actual code reduction benefits after infrastructure is in place

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by refactoring team settings page and verifying all forms, buttons, and cards work identically to before

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** team settings page uses inline styled divs, **When** refactored to use ThemedCard, **Then** page renders identically and all functionality works
2. **Given** forms use inline styled inputs, **When** refactored to use ThemedInput/ThemedTextarea, **Then** form submission and validation work identically
3. **Given** buttons use inline styles, **When** refactored to use ThemedButton, **Then** click handlers and disabled states work identically

### Edge Cases

- What happens when theme variables are not defined? Components should have fallback colors
- How does system handle components in nested theme contexts? Should inherit from parent
- What happens when Flowbite component conflicts with our theme? Use theme variables to override
- How do components behave when disabled? Should maintain theme colors but reduce opacity
- What happens during theme switching (light/dark)? Components should re-render with new theme colors immediately

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide ThemedCard component that automatically applies theme background, border, and text colors
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide ThemedInput component that supports all standard HTML input types and events
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide ThemedButton component with variants (primary, secondary, danger, warning)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide ThemedTextarea component with character count support
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide ThemedSelect component for dropdown selections
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide ThemedAlert component for success/error/warning/info messages
- **FR-007**: All themed components MUST use CSS custom properties (theme variables) instead of hardcoded colors
- **FR-008**: All themed components MUST support standard HTML events (click, input, change, blur, focus)
- **FR-009**: Flowbite Svelte MUST be installed and configured with Tailwind CSS v3
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing dashboard widgets through component wrappers
- **FR-011**: Constitution and memory system MUST be updated to reflect Flowbite Svelte as primary UI library
- **FR-012**: All refactored pages MUST maintain identical functionality to original implementation

### Key Components

- **ThemedCard**: Reusable card/section container with automatic theme styling, optional title prop
- **ThemedInput**: Text input field with theme colors, supports all input types and standard events
- **ThemedTextarea**: Multi-line text input with theme colors and character count
- **ThemedButton**: Button with theme-aware variants (primary uses accent color, danger uses error color)
- **ThemedSelect**: Dropdown select with theme colors
- **ThemedAlert**: Alert/message component with semantic types (success, error, warning, info)
- **Button/Badge/Card Wrappers**: Backward compatibility wrappers for existing dashboard widgets

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Code duplication reduced by at least 50% (measured by lines of repeated inline styling code)
- **SC-002**: All themed components render correctly in both light and dark modes without visual bugs
- **SC-003**: All refactored pages maintain 100% functional parity with original implementation
- **SC-004**: Theme switching occurs instantly (<100ms) with no visual flicker
- **SC-005**: All forms submit successfully and validation works identically to before refactor
- **SC-006**: Zero hardcoded colors remain in refactored components (all use theme variables)
- **SC-007**: Developer can create a new themed form in under 5 minutes using reusable components
- **SC-008**: Build time does not increase by more than 10% after adding Flowbite Svelte
