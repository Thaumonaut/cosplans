# Tasks: UI Library Migration to Flowbite Svelte

**Feature**: UI Library Migration to Flowbite Svelte  
**Branch**: `044-ui-flowbite-migration`  
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Summary

Total tasks to complete the UI library migration from shadcn-svelte to Flowbite Svelte with reusable themed components.

**Task Count**: 24 tasks
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 6 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
- Phase 3 (US1 - Themed Components): 0 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Phase 4 (US2 - Flowbite Migration): 0 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Phase 5 (US3 - Page Refactoring): 10 tasks (üîÑ 2 complete, 8 remaining)
- Phase 6 (Polish): 5 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 8 tasks can run in parallel during page refactoring phase

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Themed Components) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Implementation Strategy

This migration follows an incremental delivery approach:
1. ‚úÖ **Setup & Infrastructure** (Phase 1-2) - Foundation complete
2. ‚úÖ **Core Components** (US1) - All themed components created
3. ‚úÖ **Library Integration** (US2) - Flowbite Svelte installed and configured
4. üîÑ **Page Migration** (US3) - Refactor pages incrementally, test each
5. ‚è≥ **Polish** (Final) - Tests, documentation, cleanup

Each user story delivers independently testable value and can be deployed separately using feature flags.

## Phase 1: Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Install Flowbite Svelte and configure Tailwind CSS v3

**Status**: All setup tasks complete

- [x] T001 Install Flowbite Svelte v1.18.0 and flowbite v3.1.2 via `bun add -D flowbite-svelte flowbite`
- [x] T002 Configure Tailwind CSS v3 with Flowbite plugin in `tailwind.config.js`
- [x] T003 Update `components.json` to remove shadcn config references

---

## Phase 2: Foundational ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Create reusable themed component system

**Status**: All foundational components created

**Independent Test**: Import and render any themed component - it should display with correct theme variables in both light and dark modes

### Core Themed Components

- [x] T004 [P] Create ThemedCard component in `src/lib/components/ui/ThemedCard.svelte`
- [x] T005 [P] Create ThemedInput component in `src/lib/components/ui/ThemedInput.svelte`
- [x] T006 [P] Create ThemedTextarea component in `src/lib/components/ui/ThemedTextarea.svelte`
- [x] T007 [P] Create ThemedButton component in `src/lib/components/ui/ThemedButton.svelte`
- [x] T008 [P] Create ThemedSelect component in `src/lib/components/ui/ThemedSelect.svelte`
- [x] T009 [P] Create ThemedAlert component in `src/lib/components/ui/ThemedAlert.svelte`

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Reusable Themed Components (P1) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Story Goal**: Developers have reusable UI components that automatically use theme variables

**Priority**: P1 (Critical - Foundation for all other work)

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Independent Test**: 
- Create a test page using ThemedCard, ThemedInput, and ThemedButton
- Verify components render with theme background, border, and text colors
- Switch between light and dark modes - all components should adapt automatically
- All standard HTML events (click, input, change) should work

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. ‚úÖ ThemedCard renders with theme background, border, and text colors
2. ‚úÖ ThemedInput renders with theme colors and supports all standard HTML input events
3. ‚úÖ ThemedButton renders with theme accent color and supports click events

**Tasks**: All complete (T004-T009 in Phase 2)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Migrate Flowbite Svelte Library (P1) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Story Goal**: Developers can use Flowbite Svelte components for complex UI patterns

**Priority**: P1 (Critical - Replaces incompatible shadcn-svelte)

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Independent Test**:
- Import `{ Modal } from 'flowbite-svelte'` in a test component
- Import should succeed without errors
- Flowbite components should render with correct Flowbite styles

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. ‚úÖ Flowbite Svelte installed and imports work
2. ‚úÖ Tailwind configured with Flowbite plugin
3. ‚úÖ Flowbite components render correctly

**Tasks**: All complete (T001-T003 in Phase 1)

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Refactor Existing Pages (P2) üîÑ IN PROGRESS

**Story Goal**: Existing pages use new reusable components to reduce code duplication

**Priority**: P2 (Delivers code reduction benefits)

**Status**: üîÑ 20% Complete (Team Information section done)

**Independent Test**:
- Navigate to refactored team settings page
- All forms should submit successfully
- All buttons should respond to clicks
- All inputs should accept text and validate correctly
- Page should render identically to before refactoring
- Theme switching should work instantly with no visual bugs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. üîÑ Team settings page uses ThemedCard (partially done)
2. üîÑ Forms use ThemedInput/ThemedTextarea (partially done)
3. ‚è≥ Buttons use ThemedButton (partially done)
4. ‚è≥ All functionality works identically to before

### Team Settings Page Refactoring

- [x] T010 [US3] Refactor Team Information section in `src/routes/(auth)/teams/[teamId]/+page.svelte` to use ThemedCard, ThemedInput, ThemedTextarea, ThemedButton
- [x] T011 [US3] Refactor success/error messages in Team Information section to use ThemedAlert

- [x] T012 [US3] Refactor Team Management section (Create Team form) in `src/routes/(auth)/teams/[teamId]/+page.svelte` to use ThemedCard, ThemedInput, ThemedTextarea, ThemedButton
- [x] T013 [US3] Refactor Join Team section in `src/routes/(auth)/teams/[teamId]/+page.svelte` to use ThemedInput, ThemedButton

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational - Themed Components)
    ‚Üì
Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üê ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    ‚Üì
Phase 4 (US2) ‚Üê ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    ‚Üì
Phase 5 (US3) ‚Üê üîÑ IN PROGRESS
    ‚Üì
Phase 6 (Polish)
```

**Key Dependencies**:
- US1 and US2 are independent (both P1) - ‚úÖ Both complete
- US3 depends on US1 (needs themed components) - üîÑ In progress
- Polish phase depends on all user stories being complete

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Phase 5 (Page Refactoring)**:
- T012-T015 (Team settings sections) can be done sequentially (same file)
- T017-T019 (Onboarding page) can run in parallel with T012-T015 (different file)

**Within Phase 6 (Polish)**:
- T020-T022 (Component tests) can all run in parallel (different files)
- T023-T024 (Documentation) can run in parallel with tests

**Parallel Groups**:
```
Group 1 (Team Settings):
  T012 ‚Üí T013 ‚Üí T014 ‚Üí T015 ‚Üí T016

Group 2 (Onboarding - can run parallel to Group 1):
  T017 ‚Üí T018 ‚Üí T019

Group 3 (Tests - can run parallel):
  T020, T021, T022

Group 4 (Docs - can run parallel with tests):
  T023, T024
```
