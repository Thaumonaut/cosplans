## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Foundation → P1 Stories**: Database setup and core infrastructure must be complete before user story implementation
2. **Dashboard Overview → Other Stories**: Dashboard layout system required for progress tracker and inventory lifecycle integration  
3. **Progress Tracker → Timeline**: Progress data needed for timeline milestone calculations
4. **Real-time Infrastructure → All Features**: SSE and collaborative editing affects all user stories

### Parallelization Opportunities:
- Database table creation can be done in parallel across entities
- P1 user stories can be developed concurrently after foundation is complete
- P2 and P3 stories are independent and can be parallelized
- Testing can be written alongside feature development

### Risk Mitigation:
- Real-time SSE implementation is high-risk; implement fallback polling mechanism
- Yjs CRDT integration is complex; create isolated spike for conflict resolution testing  
- Timeline performance may be challenging; implement data virtualization early
- Mobile responsiveness requires continuous testing across phases

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Constraints:
- All components must be responsive (320px-4K viewport support)
- Real-time updates must arrive within 2 seconds 
- Initial page loads must complete within 3 seconds on 3G networks
- Support for 50+ shoots in timeline view simultaneously
- Handle 20+ concurrent team members with conflict resolution

### Code Quality Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode enforced across codebase
- Components must have corresponding test suites (>80% coverage)
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- ESLint and Prettier formatting enforced
- API contracts must match OpenAPI specification exactly

### Deployment Strategy:
- Feature flags for gradual P2/P3 rollout after P1 stability
- Database migrations with rollback procedures  
- CDN optimization for dashboard assets
- Performance monitoring for real-time update latency
