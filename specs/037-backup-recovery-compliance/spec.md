# Feature Specification: Data Backup, Recovery & Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `037-backup-recovery-compliance`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Automated data backup, disaster recovery procedures, and legal compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Backups (Priority: P1)

Users need confidence that their data is regularly backed up and protected against data loss from system failures or disasters.

**Why this priority**: Data loss is catastrophic for users; backups are essential infrastructure component that users may not see but absolutely depend on.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying backup system is configured, backups are executed successfully, and backup integrity can be verified.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app is running in production, **When** automated backup schedule runs (daily), **Then** complete backup of database and user files is created
2. **Given** backup process completes, **When** backup integrity is verified, **Then** backup is valid and can be used for recovery
3. **Given** multiple backups exist, **When** backup storage is checked, **Then** backups are retained for minimum 30 days (with oldest periodically deleted)

---

### User Story 2 - Data Recovery and Disaster Recovery (Priority: P1)

If data loss or system failure occurs, admins and the system need to restore data quickly from backups with minimal downtime.

**Why this priority**: Without recovery capability, backups are worthless; users depend on system availability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating data loss scenario, executing recovery from backup, and verifying data is restored correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** accidental data deletion or corruption occurs, **When** admin initiates recovery, **Then** system can restore data from backup (point-in-time recovery available)
2. **Given** recovery process completes, **When** data integrity is verified, **Then** recovered data matches pre-failure state exactly
3. **Given** complete system failure occurs, **When** disaster recovery plan is executed, **Then** system is fully operational within 4 hours with zero data loss

---

### User Story 3 - Right to Access and Data Export (Priority: P1)

Users need to access and export their data in standard formats for portability and compliance with regulations like GDPR.

**Why this priority**: Legal requirement in many jurisdictions; users should own their data and be able to take it elsewhere.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting data export for a user and verifying exported file contains all user-generated data in accessible format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user requests their data export, **When** request is submitted, **Then** email is sent within 24 hours with downloadable archive
2. **Given** data export is downloaded, **When** file is extracted, **Then** all user data (projects, photos, documents, communications) is included in standard formats (JSON, CSV, media files)
3. **Given** user accesses settings, **When** they view "My Data" section, **Then** they can see what data the system holds about them

---

### User Story 4 - Right to Deletion and GDPR Compliance (Priority: P1)

Users need to be able to delete their account and have all personal data removed from the system in compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws.

**Why this priority**: Legal requirement; users have right to be forgotten under GDPR and similar regulations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting user account and verifying personal data is removed from all systems within legally required timeframe.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user requests account deletion, **When** deletion is requested, **Then** confirmation is required (confirmation link sent to email)
2. **Given** account deletion is confirmed, **When** system processes deletion, **Then** all personal data is deleted within 30 days
3. **Given** deletion is complete, **When** attempting to access account, **Then** account and data are no longer available
4. **Given** user had shared content with others, **When** account is deleted, **Then** content is either deleted or transferred to appropriate parties (per legal requirements)

---

### User Story 5 - Compliance Auditing and Data Privacy (Priority: P2)

System admins need audit logs and compliance reporting to demonstrate adherence to regulations and respond to compliance inquiries.

**Why this priority**: Organizations need to prove compliance if audited; audit trails are legal requirement for handling sensitive data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating audit reports and verifying they contain required information (who accessed what when, data modifications, deletions).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin needs to audit user access, **When** they generate audit report, **Then** report shows all access to sensitive data (who, what, when)
2. **Given** compliance inquiry arrives, **When** admin needs to demonstrate compliance, **Then** system provides necessary logs and reports to prove adherence to standards

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens if user requests deletion but has data shared with team? (Documented in compliance policy; may require admin notification to team)
- What if backup fails? (Alert is sent to ops team; retry logic attempts recovery; alert escalates if unresolved)
- What if user requests export of 50GB of data? (Phased export or notification that data is large; generated in background)
- How long are deleted user records retained? (Legal hold period, then deleted; configurable per jurisdiction)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Automated daily backups MUST be performed for all database data

- **FR-004**: Backup integrity MUST be verified automatically after each backup completes
- **FR-005**: Point-in-time recovery MUST be available for any point within backup retention window
- **FR-006**: Disaster recovery plan MUST be documented and tested quarterly
- **FR-007**: Recovery time objective (RTO) target MUST be 4 hours; recovery point objective (RPO) target MUST be 1 hour
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to request export of all their data via settings
- **FR-009**: Data export MUST be delivered within 24 hours (per GDPR requirements) in portable, machine-readable format
- **FR-010**: Data export MUST include all user-generated content, metadata, and relationships
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to request account deletion and have all personal data deleted

- **FR-013**: Deletion of personal data MUST extend to backups (deleted data not recoverable after retention period)
- **FR-014**: Audit logs MUST record all data access, modifications, and deletions with timestamp and user identity

### Key Entities

- **Backup**: Represents a backup snapshot with timestamp, size, status, and integrity check result

- **CompliancePolicy**: Configuration for data retention and deletion policies by jurisdiction
- **DataExportRequest**: User request for personal data export with status and delivery date

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-003**: Data recovery from backup can be completed within 4 hours for complete data loss
- **SC-004**: Data export requests are fulfilled within 24 hours of request with 100% completeness
- **SC-005**: Deleted user data is permanently removed from all systems (including backups) within 30 days
- **SC-006**: Audit logs are complete and accurate; no data access goes unlogged

## Assumptions

- Cloud infrastructure provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) has built-in backup and disaster recovery capabilities
- Encryption keys are managed by dedicated key management service (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Legal team provides jurisdiction-specific compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Backups can be encrypted and transmitted securely
- Data retention policies can be enforced programmatically
- Audit logs are stored in immutable, append-only system

## Dependencies

- User Authentication (020-user-authentication) - user identity for audit logs
- Photo Management (023-photo-management-storage) - file backup included
- All data-storing features - all must participate in backup system
