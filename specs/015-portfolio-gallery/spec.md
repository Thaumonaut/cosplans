# Feature Specification: Portfolio/Gallery

**Feature Branch**: `015-portfolio-gallery`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "015-portfolio-gallery"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Public Portfolio Pages (Priority: P1)

Photographers and teams can create public portfolio pages showcasing their best cosplay photoshoot work with custom URLs, organized galleries by event/character, and responsive image grids that load quickly on any device.

**Why this priority**: Core portfolio functionality that allows photographers to share their work professionally with potential clients and the cosplay community.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a portfolio page, uploading images, organizing into galleries, and accessing via custom URL with responsive layout verification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a photographer account with completed shoots, **When** user creates portfolio page and selects custom URL (e.g., /portfolio/username), **Then** page is publicly accessible with chosen URL and displays uploaded images
2. **Given** a portfolio with multiple shoots, **When** user organizes photos into galleries by event/character, **Then** galleries display as separate collections with titles and descriptions
3. **Given** a public portfolio URL, **When** visitor views on mobile/tablet/desktop, **Then** image grid adjusts responsively with optimized loading (lazy load, thumbnails)

### User Story 2 - Client Access with Codes (Priority: P2)

Photographers can generate unique access codes for private galleries, allowing clients/models to view their specific photoshoot images without requiring accounts, with optional download permissions and expiration dates.

**Why this priority**: Enables professional client delivery workflow, building on P1's public portfolio with private access control.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating private gallery, generating access code, sharing with client (no account), and verifying code-gated access with download controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed photoshoot, **When** photographer creates private gallery and generates access code, **Then** code is created with unique URL and configurable expiration date (7/30/90 days)
2. **Given** a client with access code, **When** client enters code on landing page, **Then** private gallery unlocks showing only their photos without requiring login
3. **Given** a private gallery with download permissions enabled, **When** client clicks download button, **Then** full-resolution images download as ZIP file with watermarks optionally applied

---

### User Story 3 - Watermarking & Branding (Priority: P3)

Users can apply custom watermarks (logo, text, signature) to portfolio images with configurable position, opacity, and size, plus add team branding (colors, fonts, header images) to portfolio pages for consistent professional presentation.

**Why this priority**: Protects intellectual property and enhances professional branding, building on P1-P2's sharing capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading watermark image, configuring placement/opacity, applying to gallery images, and viewing portfolio with branded theme.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a photographer with logo image, **When** user uploads watermark and configures placement (corner, center, opacity 30-100%), **Then** watermark applies to all portfolio images automatically
2. **Given** portfolio images with watermarks, **When** visitor views or downloads images, **Then** watermark is embedded on displayed/downloaded versions (not originals)
3. **Given** a team portfolio page, **When** user customizes branding (colors, fonts, header image), **Then** portfolio displays with custom theme matching team identity

---

### User Story 4 - Tags, Filters & Search (Priority: P4)

Visitors can filter portfolio galleries by tags (character, series, location, costume type), search by keywords, and sort images by date/popularity, making it easy to find specific work within large portfolios.

**Why this priority**: Improves portfolio navigation and discoverability for visitors, enhancing the viewing experience after core features are established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by tagging portfolio images, using filter dropdowns and search box to narrow results, and verifying correct images display per criteria.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** portfolio images tagged with character/series/location, **When** visitor clicks tag filter dropdown, **Then** only images matching selected tags display in gallery
2. **Given** a portfolio with 100+ images, **When** visitor types search query (e.g., "Final Fantasy"), **Then** search results show images with matching tags, titles, or descriptions
3. **Given** filtered gallery results, **When** visitor changes sort order (newest, oldest, most viewed), **Then** images reorder accordingly with smooth transition

### Edge Cases

- What happens when custom URL is already taken? System MUST check URL availability on save, show error if taken, suggest alternatives (username2, username-photo, etc.), and allow user to choose different URL
- How are large image collections handled for performance? System MUST implement lazy loading (load images as user scrolls), thumbnail generation (200x200px, 800x800px), and pagination (50 images per page) to maintain < 3s page load
- What if access code is shared publicly? System MUST allow photographers to invalidate/regenerate codes, track code usage (views, downloads), and set usage limits (max 100 views per code)
- How are expired access codes handled? System MUST automatically revoke access when expiration date passes, show "Code Expired" message to visitors, and notify photographer 48 hours before expiration
- What happens when visitor downloads gallery with 500+ images? System MUST queue ZIP generation as background job, email download link when ready (< 10 min), and expire link after 7 days
- How are watermarks applied to various aspect ratios? System MUST detect image dimensions, scale watermark proportionally (5-20% of image size), and position based on user preference (corner, center) without distortion
- What if portfolio page has no images? System MUST show placeholder state with "No images yet" message, upload button for owner, and hide empty portfolio from public listing until 1+ image added
- How are deleted images handled in shared access codes? System MUST remove deleted images from all galleries/codes immediately, show "Image Removed" placeholder in gallery view, and update download counts
