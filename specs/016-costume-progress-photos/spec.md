# Feature Specification: Weather Integration

**Feature Branch**: `008-008-weather-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Weather forecast for locations, rain/wind alerts, alternative date suggestions, indoor backup recommendations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Location Weather Forecast (Priority: P1)

As a shoot planner, I want to see the weather forecast for my shoot location and date so that I can prepare appropriate gear and plan accordingly.

**Why this priority**: Core weather visibility - essential for outdoor shoots. Immediate value with just forecast display.

**Independent Test**: User can view 7-day forecast for shoot location with temperature, conditions, precipitation chance, wind speed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** shoot has location and date set, **When** I view shoot details, **Then** weather widget displays forecast for that location/date
2. **Given** shoot is 5 days away at "Central Park, NYC", **When** I check weather, **Then** I see "Partly cloudy, 72°F, 20% rain, 8mph wind"
3. **Given** shoot location changes, **When** I update location to "Griffith Park, LA", **Then** weather forecast updates automatically for new location
4. **Given** I'm viewing shoot on mobile, **When** weather loads, **Then** forecast displays within 2 seconds with key metrics prominently

### User Story 2 - Receive Weather Alerts (Priority: P2)

As a team coordinator, I want to receive alerts when forecast predicts bad weather (rain, high wind, extreme temp) for my shoot so that I can reschedule or adjust plans proactively.

**Why this priority**: Proactive problem prevention. Builds on P1 forecast with actionable notifications.

**Independent Test**: System monitors forecast, sends alerts 48hrs and 24hrs before shoot if conditions deteriorate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** shoot is scheduled for Saturday at 2pm, **When** Friday forecast changes to "80% rain", **Then** all team members receive alert "⚠️ Rain expected for [Shoot Name] tomorrow"
2. **Given** forecast shows "35mph winds", **When** alert triggers, **Then** notification includes impact warning "High winds may affect props and outdoor lighting"
3. **Given** shoot is 3 days away, **When** forecast shows favorable conditions, **Then** no alert sent (only alerts for concerning weather)
4. **Given** I'm photographer, **When** I receive weather alert, **Then** notification links directly to shoot details with forecast and action options

### User Story 3 - Alternative Date Suggestions (Priority: P3)

As a planner dealing with bad weather, I want to see suggested alternative dates within the next 14 days that have better weather so that I can quickly reschedule.

**Why this priority**: Adds rescheduling assistance when P2 alerts indicate problems. Saves manual forecast checking.

**Independent Test**: When bad weather detected, system suggests 3 alternative dates with better conditions and team availability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Saturday shoot has 70% rain forecast, **When** I view weather widget, **Then** system suggests "Better weather: Sunday (20% rain), Tuesday (10% rain), Next Saturday (clear)"
2. **Given** I click alternative date "Tuesday", **When** checking team availability, **Then** system shows which team members are available that day (integration with calendar)
3. **Given** alternative suggestions exist, **When** I select "Move shoot to Tuesday", **Then** reschedule workflow begins with pre-filled date
4. **Given** no better weather in next 14 days, **When** viewing suggestions, **Then** shows "No significantly better weather forecast soon" with indoor backup recommendation

---

### User Story 4 - Indoor Backup Recommendations (Priority: P4)

As a planner facing unavoidable bad weather, I want indoor location suggestions near my original outdoor location so that I can pivot to indoor shoot without canceling.

**Why this priority**: Contingency planning when rescheduling isn't possible. Nice-to-have but not essential.

**Independent Test**: System suggests indoor venues within 5 miles of original location when bad weather forecast.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** outdoor shoot has bad weather and no better dates, **When** I view backup options, **Then** system suggests "Indoor alternatives: [Local Studio A - 2mi], [Shopping Mall Atrium - 3.5mi], [Public Library - 4mi]"
2. **Given** I select indoor alternative, **When** viewing details, **Then** see venue type, distance, typical availability, and link to add as new location
3. **Given** original location is beach, **When** requesting backups, **Then** suggestions prioritize venues with natural light or open spaces (smart matching)
4. **Given** I use indoor backup, **When** shoot completes, **Then** system learns preference for future weather contingency suggestions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when shoot location is not specific enough for weather? (Prompt for precise location, or use city-level forecast with disclaimer)
- How to handle shoots spanning multiple hours with changing conditions? (Show hourly forecast for shoot time window)
- What if weather API is down or rate limited? (Cache last forecast, show staleness indicator "Last updated 3 hours ago")
- Should weather preferences be customizable per user? (Some photographers love overcast, others avoid it - allow setting preferences)
- How to handle international locations with different weather services? (Support multiple weather APIs, fallback chain)
- What about indoor shoots that don't need weather? (Auto-detect indoor vs outdoor location type, skip weather for indoor)
- Should historical weather data inform planning? (Future: "This location has 60% rain chance in October historically")
- How to handle last-minute weather changes? (Real-time monitoring day-of with push notifications for significant changes)
