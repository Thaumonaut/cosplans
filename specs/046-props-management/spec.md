# Props Management

## Overview

Comprehensive management system for prop creation, tracking, and lifecycle management, including construction resources and material tracking.

## User Stories

### User Story 1 - Prop Inventory Management (Priority: P1)

Cosplayers need to track individual props through their complete lifecycle from planning to completion or disposal.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality for managing prop resources; enables proper inventory tracking and cost management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating prop items, updating their status, and verifying state transitions work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add a prop, **When** they create it, **Then** they can specify type, character association, and initial status
2. **Given** a prop exists, **When** updating its status, **Then** the state transition follows the defined lifecycle rules
3. **Given** a prop is sold or damaged, **When** updating status, **Then** required financial or damage details must be provided

### User Story 2 - Prop Construction Resources (Priority: P2)

Users need to store and organize construction references, tutorials, and material lists for their props.

**Why this priority**: Essential for DIY prop construction; helps organize construction resources and share knowledge within teams.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading construction files, organizing them by prop, and verifying they're accessible when needed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has construction references, **When** they upload them to a prop, **Then** references are organized by prop and accessible during construction
2. **Given** construction resources exist for a prop, **When** viewing the prop details, **Then** all associated resources are displayed
3. **Given** a user wants to share construction knowledge, **When** they mark resources as shareable, **Then** team members can access them

### User Story 3 - Material and Supply Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users need to track materials used, suppliers, and costs for prop construction.

**Why this priority**: Helps manage construction costs and resource planning; enables better budgeting and supplier management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding material usage, updating costs, and verifying the information is properly tracked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is constructing a prop, **When** they record material usage, **Then** materials are tracked with costs and suppliers
2. **Given** materials are purchased, **When** recording purchases, **Then** costs are tracked and associated with the prop
3. **Given** suppliers are used, **When** recording supplier information, **Then** supplier details are stored for future reference

### User Story 4 - Prop Construction Progress (Priority: P2)

Users need to track construction progress, techniques used, and construction notes for their props.

**Why this priority**: Helps manage complex construction projects; enables better planning and knowledge sharing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding construction notes, updating progress, and verifying the information is properly organized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is constructing a prop, **When** they add construction notes, **Then** notes are timestamped and associated with the prop
2. **Given** construction is in progress, **When** updating progress, **Then** the prop status reflects current construction state
3. **Given** techniques are used, **When** recording techniques, **Then** techniques are documented for future reference
