# Feature Specification: API Documentation & Third-Party Integration

**Feature Branch**: `040-api-documentation`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: RESTful API documentation, webhooks, and third-party integration capabilities for extensibility

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Complete API Documentation (Priority: P1)

Developers need comprehensive documentation of all API endpoints, parameters, and responses so they can integrate with Cosplans or build custom solutions.

**Why this priority**: Essential for third-party integrations and developer ecosystem; poor API docs frustrate developers and slow adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using documentation to build a working API integration and verify it functions correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer accesses API documentation, **When** they browse endpoints, **Then** all endpoints are documented with method, path, parameters, and responses
2. **Given** developer reads documentation, **When** they examine request example, **Then** examples show real working requests with actual parameters
3. **Given** developer examines response, **When** they read response schema, **Then** all response fields are documented with type and description
4. **Given** developer encounters unclear behavior, **When** they search docs, **Then** edge cases and error responses are documented

---

### User Story 2 - Authentication and Rate Limiting Information (Priority: P1)

Developers need clear guidance on API authentication (API keys, OAuth tokens) and rate limiting so their integrations don't break.

**Why this priority**: Authentication and rate limits are critical to using API; unclear documentation causes failed integrations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by obtaining API credentials, making authenticated requests, and verifying rate limits are enforced as documented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer needs API access, **When** they generate API key, **Then** key is securely generated and documented in account settings
2. **Given** developer makes API requests, **When** they are rate limited, **Then** rate limit headers show remaining requests and reset time
3. **Given** developer examines auth docs, **When** they read authentication methods, **Then** all auth options (API key, OAuth2, JWT) are clearly documented

---

### User Story 3 - Webhook Support for Real-Time Events (Priority: P2)

Developers need webhook capabilities so their integrations can react in real-time to events (shoot created, photo uploaded, chat message posted) without polling.

**Why this priority**: Enables event-driven integrations; reduces polling load; creates rich integration possibilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring webhook, triggering event, and verifying webhook payload is delivered to URL.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer configures webhook for an event type, **When** event occurs, **Then** HTTP POST is sent to registered webhook URL with event payload
2. **Given** webhook delivery fails, **When** retry logic executes, **Then** webhook is retried with exponential backoff (configurable)
3. **Given** developer receives webhook, **When** they examine payload, **Then** payload includes event type, timestamp, and complete event data

---

### User Story 4 - Sandbox/Testing Environment (Priority: P2)

Developers need a sandbox environment to test integrations without affecting production data.

**Why this priority**: Prevents accidental data corruption and allows safe testing; standard practice for APIs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing sandbox environment, making API calls, and verifying sandbox data is isolated from production.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer accesses sandbox environment, **When** they make API calls, **Then** sandbox operates independently with separate credentials
2. **Given** developer tests integration in sandbox, **When** they create test data, **Then** test data does not affect production users or data

---

### User Story 5 - SDKs and Client Libraries (Priority: P3)

Developers using popular languages (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.) need SDKs to simplify API integration and reduce boilerplate code.

**Why this priority**: Improves developer experience; reduces integration time; increases adoption among developers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using SDK to make API calls and verifying SDK handles auth, retries, and serialization correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer installs SDK for their language, **When** they use SDK, **Then** all API endpoints are available as SDK methods
2. **Given** developer uses SDK, **When** they make API calls, **Then** authentication, serialization, and error handling is automatic

---

### Edge Cases

- What if webhook URL becomes unreachable? (Retries with backoff; admin is alerted; integration can be disabled)
- What if API changes (breaking change)? (API versioning used; old version supported for transition period)
- What if developer loses API key? (Key can be revoked and new one generated; old key stops working immediately)
- What if developer exceeds rate limit? (Request is rejected with 429 status; retry-after header indicates when to retry)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Complete API documentation MUST be published and publicly accessible (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI spec)
- **FR-002**: API documentation MUST include all endpoints, HTTP methods, parameters, request/response bodies, and error codes
- **FR-003**: API documentation MUST include working code examples in popular languages (Python, JavaScript, cURL)
- **FR-004**: API documentation MUST include authentication section explaining all supported methods (API key, OAuth2, JWT)
- **FR-005**: API MUST support API key authentication via header or query parameter
- **FR-006**: API MUST support OAuth2 for third-party applications requesting user permissions
- **FR-007**: API MUST implement rate limiting (default: 1000 requests/hour per API key) with 429 status when limit exceeded
- **FR-008**: Rate limit headers MUST be returned (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- **FR-009**: API MUST support webhook configuration via settings/admin panel
- **FR-010**: Webhooks MUST deliver events in JSON format with event type, timestamp, and event data
- **FR-011**: Failed webhook deliveries MUST be retried with exponential backoff (configurable max retries)
- **FR-012**: Webhook delivery MUST include signature header (HMAC-SHA256) for verification by receiver
- **FR-013**: API MUST support filtering, sorting, and pagination for list endpoints
- **FR-014**: API MUST use consistent error response format with error codes, messages, and details
- **FR-015**: API MUST include sandbox/test environment with separate credentials and data
- **FR-016**: API versioning MUST be supported (e.g., /api/v1/, /api/v2/) with deprecation timeline

- **FR-020**: API changelog MUST be maintained and published documenting breaking changes and new features

### Key Entities

- **APIEndpoint**: Defined API route with method, parameters, authentication requirements, and rate limits
- **Webhook**: Registered event handler URL with event types, delivery history, and retry configuration
- **APILog**: Audit trail of API calls including user/app, endpoint, status, timestamp

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: API documentation is complete with 100% of endpoints documented
- **SC-002**: Developers can successfully integrate with API using documentation within 1-2 hours (per user testing)
- **SC-003**: API uptime is 99.9% or greater; unavailability is communicated in advance
- **SC-004**: 95% of API requests complete within 500ms response time
- **SC-005**: Webhook delivery success rate is 99.5% (with automatic retries)
- **SC-006**: Third-party developers report 90%+ satisfaction with API documentation and SDKs
- **SC-007**: Active API usage reaches 50+ third-party integrations within 12 months of launch

## Assumptions

- API is designed using RESTful principles with standard HTTP verbs
- Documentation is maintained using OpenAPI/Swagger format
- Webhooks use HTTP POST with JSON payload and HMAC signature verification
- Rate limiting is implemented at application layer or via API gateway
- Sandbox environment has same schema and functionality as production (with test data only)
- SDKs are open-source and hosted on package managers (PyPI, npm, etc.)

## Dependencies

- User Authentication (020-user-authentication) - API authentication and OAuth
- Permissions & Access Control (022-permissions-access-control) - API scopes and permissions
- All features - all features that have value to third parties should have API access
