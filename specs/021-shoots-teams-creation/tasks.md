# Tasks: Shoots & Teams Creation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/021-shoots-teams-creation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Sequential)

1. **Phase 1: Setup** ‚Üí **Phase 2: Foundational** (MUST complete first)
2. **Phase 2** ‚Üí **Phase 3: User Story 1** (team creation)
3. **Phase 3** ‚Üí **Phase 3.5: Onboarding** (unblocks auth completion)
4. **Phase 3.5** ‚Üí **Phase 4: User Story 2** (invitations)

### Parallel Opportunities

After Phase 2 is complete, these can run in parallel:
- User Story 1 (team creation)
- User Story 5 (team hierarchy views)

After Phase 4 is complete, these can run in parallel:
- User Story 6 (member management)
- Phase 7 (real-time updates)
- Phase 8 (deletion & transfer)

### User Story Completion Order

**Priority 1 (MVP - Must Have)**:
1. US1: Create a New Team ‚úÖ
2. Onboarding with Team Creation ‚úÖ (Constitutional blocker)
3. US2: Add Members to Team ‚úÖ
4. Real-Time Collaboration ‚úÖ (Constitutional requirement)

**Priority 2 (Important - Should Have)**:
