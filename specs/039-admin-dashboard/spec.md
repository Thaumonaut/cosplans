# Feature Specification: Admin Dashboard & System Management

**Feature Branch**: `039-admin-dashboard`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Administrative interface for system-wide management, monitoring, user management, and moderation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - System Health and Analytics Monitoring (Priority: P1)

Admin staff need visibility into system health, performance metrics, and usage analytics to monitor app status and identify issues.

**Why this priority**: Critical for ops team to maintain system availability and performance; enables proactive issue detection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing admin dashboard and verifying all metrics display correctly and update in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin accesses dashboard, **When** they view system health, **Then** metrics show uptime percentage, API response time, error rates, and resource usage
2. **Given** performance metric changes, **When** dashboard updates, **Then** alerts trigger if metrics exceed thresholds (e.g., error rate > 1%)
3. **Given** admin needs historical data, **When** they view analytics, **Then** charts show trends over time (last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days)

---

### User Story 2 - User and Account Management (Priority: P1)

Admins need to manage user accounts (create, disable, reset passwords) and manage user roles and permissions to support user operations.

**Why this priority**: Ops team needs ability to support users and recover from account lockout scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using admin functions to create user account, modify account, and verify changes take effect.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin needs to help user reset password, **When** they generate reset link, **Then** link is created and can be sent to user
2. **Given** user account is compromised, **When** admin disables account, **Then** user cannot log in until admin re-enables
3. **Given** admin manages roles, **When** they assign user to admin/moderator role, **Then** user immediately gains elevated permissions

---

### User Story 3 - Moderation and Report Handling (Priority: P2)

Moderators need tools to review reported content, take action against abuse, and maintain platform safety.

**Why this priority**: Prevents abuse and harassment; ensures platform remains safe for users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating abuse report, accessing moderation queue, and taking moderation action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user reports inappropriate content, **When** report is submitted, **Then** it appears in moderation queue with context
2. **Given** moderator reviews report, **When** they take action (warn user, delete content, ban user), **Then** action is executed and logged
3. **Given** action is taken, **When** affected user is notified, **Then** they receive notification explaining the action and opportunity to appeal

---

### User Story 4 - Audit Logs and Compliance Reporting (Priority: P1)

Admins need access to detailed audit logs and ability to generate compliance reports to demonstrate adherence to regulations.

**Why this priority**: Legal and compliance requirement; necessary for SOC 2, GDPR, and other audits.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating audit report and verifying it contains required information with proper search/filter capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin needs to audit user actions, **When** they search audit logs, **Then** they can filter by user, action type, date range, and resource
2. **Given** compliance audit occurs, **When** admin generates report, **Then** report shows all relevant logs proving compliance
3. **Given** sensitive data is accessed, **When** audit log is checked, **Then** access is logged with who, what, when, from where

---

### User Story 5 - Configuration and Feature Management (Priority: P2)

Admins need to configure app settings, enable/disable features, and manage system-wide settings without requiring code changes.

**Why this priority**: Enables rapid response to issues and feature control without deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing configuration setting and verifying effect is applied immediately to all users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin needs to adjust setting (e.g., max file upload size), **When** they change it in settings panel, **Then** change applies immediately to all new operations
2. **Given** feature flag system is used, **When** admin enables/disables feature, **Then** feature is immediately available/unavailable to users (per configuration)
3. **Given** maintenance window occurs, **When** admin enables maintenance mode, **Then** app displays maintenance message and restricts non-critical operations

---

### Edge Cases

- What if admin accidentally disables critical feature? (Admin confirmation dialogs; change history with undo capability)
- How are multi-level admins handled? (Permission hierarchy: super admin > admin > moderator; each level has defined capabilities)
- What if sensitive admin action occurs? (All admin actions are logged; changes can be audited)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
