# Feature Specification: Notification System

**Feature Branch**: `031-notification-system`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Unified notification system for app-wide alerts and updates

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Receive In-App Notifications (Priority: P1)

Users need to be notified of important events within the app without leaving the platform. This includes mentions, team updates, deadline reminders, and activity alerts.

**Why this priority**: Core to user engagement and prevents users from missing critical information that impacts collaboration and project timelines.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering notification-generating events (mentions, team invites, deadline alerts) and verifying in-app notification appears immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in and another user mentions them in a comment, **When** the comment is posted, **Then** the mentioned user receives an in-app notification badge and notification center entry
2. **Given** a user has team activity notifications enabled, **When** a team member joins their shoot, **Then** an in-app notification appears within 2 seconds
3. **Given** a user receives multiple notifications, **When** they access the notification center, **Then** notifications are displayed in reverse chronological order with clear action buttons
4. **Given** a user is viewing the main interface, **When** a notification arrives, **Then** a visual indicator (badge count) updates in the notification icon immediately

### User Story 2 - Receive Email Notifications (Priority: P2)

Users need to stay informed about important events even when they're not actively using the app, via email notifications.

**Why this priority**: Ensures users don't miss time-sensitive information like shoot scheduling changes, form completions, or important team announcements even when offline.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering notification events while user is logged out, verifying email is sent with proper formatting and contains actionable information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** email notifications are enabled for a user, **When** an important event occurs (e.g., shoot date changed), **Then** an email is sent within 5 minutes with event details and action link
2. **Given** a user receives multiple notifications in quick succession, **When** they check their email, **Then** notifications may be batched into a single digest email (if digest mode enabled)
3. **Given** an email notification is sent, **When** user clicks a link in the email, **Then** they are taken directly to the relevant content in the app

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Notification Preferences (Priority: P1)

Users need control over what, when, and how they receive notifications to avoid notification fatigue and customize their experience.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user retention; uncontrolled notifications cause users to disable all notifications or abandon the app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by modifying notification settings and verifying that disabled notification types do not generate alerts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses notification settings, **When** they disable a notification type (e.g., "Comments on my posts"), **Then** notifications of that type no longer appear in any channel (in-app, email, SMS)
2. **Given** a user has quiet hours enabled (e.g., 10 PM - 8 AM), **When** notifications arrive during quiet hours, **Then** they are queued and delivered after quiet hours end
3. **Given** a user wants to control granularity, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can configure notifications per feature (team communication, shoots, budget, etc.) and per channel independently
4. **Given** a user disables all notifications, **When** they later re-enable, **Then** their previous preference settings are restored

### User Story 4 - Receive Push Notifications (Priority: P2)

Users with the mobile app installed need push notifications for immediate, app-independent alerts on their device.

**Why this priority**: Enhances mobile experience and ensures critical alerts reach users instantly regardless of app or browser state.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on mobile devices/emulators by installing the app, enabling push notifications, triggering events, and verifying device receives push notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has the mobile app installed and push notifications enabled, **When** they receive a mention or urgent alert, **Then** a push notification appears on their device lock screen within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a push notification is received, **When** user taps it, **Then** the app opens directly to the relevant content
3. **Given** a user disables push notifications in app settings, **When** an event occurs, **Then** no push notification is sent to their device

---

### User Story 5 - View Notification History (Priority: P2)

Users need to access past notifications for reference, audit trails, and catching up on missed information.

**Why this priority**: Provides users with a safety net for missed notifications and helps with project auditing and accountability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the notification center, applying filters/search, and verifying past notifications are retrievable and organized logically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the notification center, **When** they view past notifications, **Then** notifications from the last 30 days are visible with clear timestamps
2. **Given** a user has many notifications, **When** they filter by type or sender, **Then** only matching notifications are shown
3. **Given** a user views a past notification, **When** they click "View", **Then** they are taken to the original content even if content has been modified or deleted (with appropriate messaging)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user deletes their account? (All associated notifications should be deleted)
- How does system handle when a user loses network connectivity? (Queue notifications and deliver when reconnected)
- What if a notification-generating event is deleted/modified? (Notification remains but may show "item no longer available")
- What if user has conflicting notification settings across devices? (Settings sync across devices; last update wins)
- How does system handle spam/abuse notifications? (Flag mechanism, blocking users who send excessive notifications)
- What happens if email delivery fails? (Retry mechanism, fallback to in-app notification)
- How are notifications handled for archived or deleted shoots/teams? (Stop sending new notifications; keep past ones for history)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## Assumptions

- Users have valid email addresses in their profiles for email notifications
- Mobile push notifications require users to explicitly opt-in and install the app
- Email service provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.) is available and reliable
- Push notification service (Firebase, OneSignal, etc.) is configured and operational
- Users have accepted browser/app notifications permissions for in-app and push notifications to function
- Notification delivery retries use exponential backoff strategy
- Historical notifications older than 30 days may be archived to improve performance
- Quiet hours use user's timezone for scheduling

## Dependencies

- User Authentication (020-user-authentication) - must know who the user is
- Permissions & Access Control (022-permissions-access-control) - must determine notification recipients
- Team Communication (004-team-communication) - key source of notifications
- Real-Time Sync (024-realtime-sync-offline) - for live notification delivery
