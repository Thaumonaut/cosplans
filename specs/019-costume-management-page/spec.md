# Feature Specification: Costume Management Page

**Feature Branch**: `019-costume-management-page`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "costume management page. A dedicated page for managing the lifecycle of a costume and a page dedicated to managing the lifecycle of a prop as well as any other resource that has stages and tasks linked to it"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Costume Lifecycle Management (Priority: P1)

Users can view and manage the lifecycle of a costume, including all stages (planned, acquiring, in-progress, ready, owned) and post-use states (sold, damaged, rented, lost) with metadata tracking.

**Why this priority**: Ensures compliance with inventory lifecycle standards and provides a centralized view for managing costume states.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating costume states and verifying historical preservation, metadata accuracy, and compliance with Principle IV.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a costume is marked as "Planned", **When** user updates its state to "In-Progress", **Then** the system logs the change with a timestamp, user attribution, and historical preservation.
2. **Given** a costume is marked as "Owned", **When** user updates its state to "Rented", **Then** the system reflects the new state with required metadata (rental period, renter details) and updates inventory value tracking.
3. **Given** a costume is marked as "Stored", **When** user updates its state to "Damaged", **Then** the system prompts for insurance documentation and logs the change with rationale.

### User Story 2 - Prop Lifecycle Management (Priority: P1)

Users can view and manage the lifecycle of a prop, including all stages and tasks linked to it, with metadata tracking and historical preservation.

**Why this priority**: Provides a dedicated interface for managing props, ensuring compliance with inventory standards and efficient task tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating prop states and verifying metadata accuracy and historical preservation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a prop is marked as "Planned", **When** user updates its state to "Acquiring", **Then** the system logs the change with a timestamp, user attribution, and historical preservation.
2. **Given** a prop is marked as "Owned", **When** user updates its state to "Lost", **Then** the system reflects the new state with required metadata and updates inventory value tracking.
3. **Given** a prop is marked as "Stored", **When** user updates its state to "Rented", **Then** the system prompts for rental details and logs the change with rationale.

### User Story 3 - Resource Lifecycle Management (Priority: P2)

Users can manage the lifecycle of any other resource with stages and tasks linked to it, ensuring compliance with inventory standards and efficient task tracking.

**Why this priority**: Extends lifecycle management capabilities to other resources, providing flexibility and comprehensive tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating resource states and verifying metadata accuracy and historical preservation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a resource is marked as "Planned", **When** user updates its state to "In-Progress", **Then** the system logs the change with a timestamp, user attribution, and historical preservation.
2. **Given** a resource is marked as "Owned", **When** user updates its state to "Damaged", **Then** the system reflects the new state with required metadata and updates inventory value tracking.
3. **Given** a resource is marked as "Stored", **When** user updates its state to "Loaned", **Then** the system prompts for loan details and logs the change with rationale.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user attempts to update a state without providing required metadata?
- How does the system handle conflicting updates from multiple users?
- What happens if a resource is marked as "Lost" but later recovered?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- The system must support all lifecycle states defined in Principle IV of the constitution.
- All state changes must be timestamped, attributed to a user, and preserved in historical logs.
- Metadata must be required for specific states (e.g., rental details for "Rented", insurance documentation for "Damaged").
- The interface must provide clear visual indicators of current state and compliance with inventory standards.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- Users can update lifecycle states with 100% accuracy in metadata tracking.
- Historical logs preserve 100% of state changes with timestamps and user attribution.
- The system supports simultaneous updates from multiple users without conflicts.
- Users report a 90% satisfaction rate with the lifecycle management interface.

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- Users have appropriate permissions to update lifecycle states.
- Metadata requirements are clearly defined and enforced by the system.
- The system integrates with existing inventory tracking tools.

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- Integration with inventory tracking tools.
- User authentication and role-based permissions.

## Notes *(optional)*

- This feature builds on Principle IV of the constitution, ensuring compliance with inventory lifecycle standards.
