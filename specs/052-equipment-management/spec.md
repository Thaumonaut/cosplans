# Equipment Management

## Overview

Comprehensive management system for photography equipment, lighting, tools, and other gear used in cosplay shoots and projects.

## User Stories

### User Story 1 - Equipment Inventory Management (Priority: P1)

Users need to track individual equipment items through their complete lifecycle from acquisition to disposal.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for equipment management; essential for organizing and tracking equipment resources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating equipment items, updating their status, and verifying state transitions work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add equipment, **When** they create it, **Then** they can specify type, model, serial number, and initial status
2. **Given** equipment exists, **When** viewing the equipment, **Then** all associated details and maintenance information are displayed
3. **Given** equipment is damaged or retired, **When** updating status, **Then** the equipment lifecycle is properly tracked

### User Story 2 - Equipment Maintenance and Care (Priority: P2)

Users need to track maintenance schedules, care instructions, and equipment condition monitoring.

**Why this priority**: Important for equipment longevity; helps maintain equipment quality and prevent failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding maintenance schedules, recording maintenance activities, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** equipment requires maintenance, **When** setting up schedules, **Then** maintenance reminders are created and trackable
2. **Given** maintenance is performed, **When** recording activities, **Then** maintenance history is updated and accessible
3. **Given** equipment is damaged, **When** updating condition, **Then** repair options and maintenance requirements are suggested

### User Story 3 - Equipment Usage and Project Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users need to track which equipment is used for which projects and shoots.

**Why this priority**: Important for project planning; helps understand equipment utilization and availability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by recording equipment usage, tracking project assignments, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** equipment is used for a project, **When** recording usage, **Then** the equipment is associated with the project
2. **Given** equipment usage is recorded, **When** viewing equipment details, **Then** usage history and project associations are displayed
3. **Given** a project needs equipment, **When** planning, **Then** available equipment is suggested based on requirements

### User Story 4 - Equipment Sharing and Availability (Priority: P2)

Users need to track equipment availability and manage sharing among team members.

**Why this priority**: Important for team coordination; helps manage equipment access and prevent conflicts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up equipment sharing, checking availability, and verifying the system works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** equipment is available for sharing, **When** setting up sharing, **Then** team members can request access
2. **Given** equipment is requested, **When** approving requests, **Then** access is granted and tracked
3. **Given** equipment is in use, **When** checking availability, **Then** current status and return date are displayed
