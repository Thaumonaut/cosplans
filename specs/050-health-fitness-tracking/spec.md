# Feature Specification: Health & Fitness Tracking (Body Measurements & Workout Planning)

**Feature Branch**: `050-health-fitness-tracking`  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Draft - Future Feature  
**Input**: User description: "Body measurement tracking and maybe even workout and fitness planning could be good future features to expand on later."

## Context

This is a **future expansion feature** to help cosplayers:
- Track body measurements over time (for costume fitting and alteration planning)
- Plan workouts for character-specific physique goals
- Monitor progress toward fitness goals for specific characters/events

**Priority**: Low (nice-to-have for later phases)

## Potential User Stories (Not Yet Prioritized)

### Measurement Tracking

**Scenario**: As a cosplayer, I want to track my body measurements (chest, waist, hips, inseam, etc.) over time so that I can:
- Create accurate costume patterns
- Know when to update outfits if measurements change
- Plan alterations for existing costumes
- Share measurements with commissioners

**Features**:
- Record measurements with dates
- Visual timeline showing measurement changes
- Link measurements to specific outfits (to track if they still fit)
- Export measurements for pattern drafting

### Fitness Goal Planning

**Scenario**: As a cosplayer preparing for a muscular character, I want to plan workouts and track progress so that I can achieve the physique for the character by the event date.

**Features**:
- Set fitness goals linked to characters ("Build muscle for Thor by July")
- Track workout sessions and progress
- Visual progress photos over time
- Integration with event deadlines (spec 048/051)

### Sizing Reference Library

**Scenario**: As a commissioner or costume buyer, I want to save sizing charts from different vendors so that I can quickly reference what size to order.

**Features**:
- Save vendor sizing charts (images/tables)
- Personal size mapping ("I'm size M in Arda Wigs, L in EZCosplay")
- Historical order sizes for future reference

## Key Questions to Resolve (Before Implementation)

1. **Scope**: Is this purely measurement tracking, or full fitness planning?
2. **Privacy**: How sensitive is measurement/body data? Need extra security?
3. **Integration**: Should this connect to wearables/fitness apps (Fitbit, MyFitnessPal)?
4. **Photos**: Support progress photo uploads? Privacy concerns?
5. **Notifications**: Remind users to update measurements monthly?
6. **Goals**: Link fitness goals to events/characters?

## Potential Dependencies

- Event/Convention entity (spec 048) - for deadline-driven fitness goals
- Character entity (spec 048) - for character-specific physique planning
- Vendor entity (spec 048) - for sizing chart library
- Photo storage (Cloudflare R2) - for progress photos

## Out of Scope (Definitely NOT Building)

- Calorie tracking / meal planning
- Medical advice or health diagnostics
- Integration with actual fitness equipment
- Social fitness challenges
- Nutrition supplements tracking

## Next Steps

1. Validate user demand through surveys/interviews
2. Research privacy regulations for health data
3. Define MVP scope (measurements only vs. full fitness)
4. Create full user stories with priorities
5. Design data model and UI mockups

**Status**: Idea captured. Will revisit after core resource management (spec 048) and convention logistics (spec 051) are implemented.
