# Feature Specification: Calendar System

**Feature Branch**: `032-calendar-system`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Unified calendar system for managing shoots, events, and availability

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View All Shoots and Events in Calendar (Priority: P1)

Users need a centralized calendar view showing all their shoots, deadlines, and team events to understand their schedule and plan their time.

**Why this priority**: Essential for project management; users need to see the full picture of their commitments and deadlines at a glance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating shoots with dates, adding deadlines, and verifying they appear correctly in calendar view with proper visual distinction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has multiple shoots scheduled, **When** they view the calendar, **Then** all shoots appear on their respective dates with shoot name visible
2. **Given** a user has team events (meetings, conventions), **When** they view calendar, **Then** team events are displayed alongside shoots with distinct visual styling
3. **Given** a shoot has multiple milestones (pre-production, shooting day, post-production), **When** viewing calendar, **Then** all milestones appear on their respective dates
4. **Given** a user clicks on a calendar date with events, **When** they expand that day, **Then** all events for that day are listed with time and action options
5. **Given** a calendar can show events up to 2 years in advance, **When** user navigates to future dates, **Then** calendar smoothly loads without lag

### User Story 2 - Sync with External Calendars (Priority: P2)

Users need to integrate their professional calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar) so their shoots and deadlines appear alongside their other commitments without manual duplication.

**Why this priority**: Reduces duplicate entry, keeps all commitments in one place, and integrates cosplay planning with users' existing workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by authorizing calendar integration, creating a shoot in Cosplans, verifying it appears in connected external calendar within 15 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user authorizes Google Calendar integration, **When** they create a new shoot in Cosplans, **Then** a corresponding event is created in their Google Calendar within 15 minutes
2. **Given** a user modifies a shoot date in Cosplans, **When** sync completes, **Then** the corresponding Google Calendar event is updated to the new date
3. **Given** a user deletes a shoot from Cosplans, **When** sync completes, **Then** the corresponding calendar event is also deleted or marked as deleted
4. **Given** a user has multiple calendars (work, personal, team), **When** they configure Cosplans integration, **Then** they can choose which calendar to sync events to
5. **Given** external calendar modifications occur, **When** next sync runs (typically every 15 minutes), **Then** Cosplans stays up-to-date with external changes

### User Story 2.1 - Display Team Members' External Events (Priority: P1)

Team leads and coordinators need to see when team members have external commitments (work meetings, personal appointments, travel) so they can avoid scheduling conflicts and respect team members' other obligations.

**Why this priority**: Essential for effective team coordination; prevents double-booking and ensures realistic scheduling that respects team members' full calendars.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting team members' external calendars, verifying their external events appear in team calendar view with proper visual distinction from shoots, and confirming events are labeled by owner.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** team members have synced their external calendars, **When** a coordinator views the team calendar, **Then** external events (meetings, appointments) from team members appear alongside shoots with clear visual distinction
2. **Given** multiple team members have external events on the same day, **When** viewing calendar, **Then** each event is clearly labeled with the team member's name who owns the event
3. **Given** an external event is marked as "busy" or "out of office", **When** viewing team calendar, **Then** the event displays with appropriate indicators showing the team member's availability status
4. **Given** team members have personal vs. work external calendars synced, **When** viewing events, **Then** events are visually distinguished by type (shoot vs. external) with different colors or icons
5. **Given** a week view displays multiple events per day, **When** there are more than 3 events on a single day, **Then** calendar shows a "+X more" indicator and allows expanding to see all events
6. **Given** external events have time information, **When** viewing calendar, **Then** events display time alongside title in a compact, readable format
7. **Given** calendar shows both shoots and external events, **When** hovering or clicking an event, **Then** user can see full details including event type icon (camera for shoots, calendar for external events)

### User Story 3 - Manage Availability and Block Time (Priority: P2)

Users need to block time for personal obligations, travel, or non-negotiable commitments so the team knows when they're unavailable.

**Why this priority**: Prevents double-booking and helps teams coordinate availability, essential for shoots requiring specific team members.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating availability blocks, verifying they appear on calendar, and checking that other team members can see this availability information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user blocks out a week for a vacation, **When** team members view availability, **Then** the user appears as unavailable/blocked for those dates
2. **Given** a user creates a availability block, **When** team members attempt to schedule a shoot on that date, **Then** a warning appears indicating the user's unavailability
3. **Given** a user can set different availability for different teams, **When** they switch between teams, **Then** their availability blocks reflect only that team's calendar view
4. **Given** availability blocks are set, **When** viewing team availability reports, **Then** blocked team members are clearly distinguished from available members

---

### User Story 4 - Set Reminders and Deadlines (Priority: P1)

Users need to set reminders for upcoming shoots and deadlines so they don't forget critical dates and have time to prepare.

**Why this priority**: Prevents missed shoots and helps users stay on top of deadlines, directly impacting project success.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a deadline, setting reminder times, and verifying reminders trigger at specified times via notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sets a reminder for 3 days before a shoot, **When** that deadline arrives, **Then** they receive a notification (in-app and/or email based on preferences)
2. **Given** a user can set multiple reminders (1 week, 3 days, 1 day before), **When** each reminder trigger time arrives, **Then** separate notifications are sent
3. **Given** a user sets a reminder, **When** the event date is postponed, **Then** the reminder automatically adjusts to the new date
4. **Given** reminders are enabled, **When** the reminder time arrives, **Then** notification includes the event name, time, and action to view/edit the event

---

### User Story 5 - View Team Availability and Schedule (Priority: P2)

Team leads and coordinators need to see when all team members are available and view the full team schedule to coordinate shoots and plan timelines.

**Why this priority**: Enables efficient team coordination, prevents scheduling conflicts, and helps optimize shoot planning.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing team availability view and verifying all team members' schedules are visible with proper color coding and filtering options.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team has multiple members with different availability, **When** a coordinator views team availability view, **Then** a visual calendar shows each member's availability color-coded
2. **Given** a shoot has multiple team members assigned, **When** viewing the shoot on calendar, **Then** icons or initials show which team members are assigned
3. **Given** a user has permission to view team schedule, **When** they access team calendar view, **Then** they can filter by team member, event type, or date range
4. **Given** a coordinator needs to find a time slot for all team members, **When** they use "find common availability" feature, **Then** system suggests dates when all required members are free

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no shoots scheduled? (Calendar shows empty state with guidance)
- How does system handle when a shoot is deleted? (Calendar event is removed; reminders are canceled)
- What if external calendar sync fails? (Notification alerts user; manual sync option provided)
- What if user revokes calendar integration permissions? (Sync stops; existing local events remain)
- How are recurring shoots handled? (Create separate calendar entries for each instance)
- What if a user has availability blocks that conflict with assigned shoots? (Warning shown; user can override if needed)
- How does system handle timezone changes? (All times are stored in UTC; displayed in user's timezone; reminders adjust if timezone preference changes)
