# Specification Quality Checklist: Resource Management System Expansion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed on initial review:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY, without prescribing HOW to implement. No framework names or technical implementations mentioned.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - All 58 functional requirements are specific and testable
   - 14 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
   - 10 edge cases identified with clear resolution approaches
   - Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - 5 user stories with priorities (P1 x 3, P2 x 2) 
   - Each user story has 4-7 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
   - All scenarios map to functional requirements
   - Success criteria align with user story outcomes

4. **Specification Quality**:
   - Comprehensive coverage of retrospective updates and new features
   - Clear integration notes with existing spec 045
   - Follows constitutional requirements for resource management
   - Maintains consistency with established patterns

## Notes

- This specification combines retrospective documentation (capturing already-implemented features) with new feature planning (tasks, patterns, supplies)
- Retrospective portion (User Story 5) documents features from spec 045 that were implemented but not captured in the original specification
- New features follow established patterns from spec 045 for consistency
- All new resource types (tasks, patterns, supplies) are team-scoped and follow same CRUD/permission model
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Specification approved and ready for planning
2. ⏭️  Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
3. ⏭️  Create data model for new entities (Task, Pattern, CraftSupply, etc.)
4. ⏭️  Define API endpoints for new resource types
5. ⏭️  Break plan into actionable tasks with `/speckit.tasks`
