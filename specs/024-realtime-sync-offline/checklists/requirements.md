# Specification Quality Checklist: Real-Time Sync & Offline Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Feature**: [024-realtime-sync-offline spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **3 clarifications remain**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Clarifications Needed**:
1. Real-Time Protocol (WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or Yjs/y-websocket?)
2. Conflict Resolution strategy (Last-write-wins, CRDT-based merge, or user-prompted?)
3. Local Storage choice (IndexedDB, SQLite, or simple JSON in localStorage?)

Recommended: Spec includes suggested implementation guidance that makes these clarifications lower priority. Ready for planning with recommended approach.
