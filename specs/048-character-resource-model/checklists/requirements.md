# Specification Quality Checklist: Character-Centric Resource Model

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed on initial review:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY, describing the character-centric resource model without prescribing implementation. Mentions R2 storage and database relationships in dependencies section only (appropriate context).

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - All 50 functional requirements are specific and testable
   - 14 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
   - 10 edge cases identified with clear resolution approaches
   - Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented
   - Integration notes clearly explain relationship to specs 045 and 047

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - 5 user stories with clear priorities (3 x P1, 2 x P2)
   - Each user story has 4-6 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
   - All scenarios map to functional requirements
   - Success criteria align with user story outcomes
   - Character-centric model clearly explained as architectural shift

4. **Specification Quality**:
   - Comprehensive coverage of character entity, wig separation, resource linking
   - Clear data model with entity descriptions and relationship types
   - Migration strategy from flat to character-centric organization
   - Maintains consistency with spec 045/047 patterns
   - Explicit about superseding/modifying previous specs

## Notes

- This specification introduces a significant architectural change: from flat resource lists to character-centric organization
- Character entity becomes the central hub for all cosplay resources (costumes, wigs, props, accessories)
- Wigs promoted from accessory subcategory to top-level resource with full project tracking
- Outfits/costumes enhanced with version tracking, patterns, and construction tasks
- Clear migration path from existing specs (045, 047) with backward compatibility
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Specification approved and ready for planning
2. ⏭️  Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
3. ⏭️  Define data model for Character entity and junction tables
4. ⏭️  Plan migration strategy from accessories to wigs
5. ⏭️  Design character-centric UI navigation
6. ⏭️  Break plan into actionable tasks with `/speckit.tasks`
