# Tasks: Comprehensive Resource Management System (Character-Centric Model)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/048-character-resource-model/`  
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (180 FRs), plan.md (5-phase strategy), ui-design.md (stress-reducing UI)

**‚ö†Ô∏è SCOPE NOTE**: This spec consolidates 3 previous specs (045, 046, 047) with 180 functional requirements and 12 resource types. To maintain **VIII.5 Solo Developer Efficiency**, tasks are broken into incremental, independently deliverable phases.

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in spec - implementation-first approach with manual testing per user story

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and delivery

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All paths relative to repository root (`C:\Projects\Web\Vibe Coding\cosplans\`):
- Components: `src/lib/components/[resource]/`
- Server services: `src/lib/server/resources/`
- Routes: `src/routes/(auth)/[resource]/`
- Database migrations: `supabase/migrations/`
- Types: `src/lib/types/resources.ts`

4. Verify wig displays on character page with status
5. Repeat for outfit, prop (future)
6. Verify completion percentage updates (completed resources / total resources)

**Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Phase 3 (Characters), ‚úÖ Phase 4 (Wigs)

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

### Character Detail Page - Linked Resources Section

- [ ] T103 [P] [US3] Update `src/routes/(auth)/characters/[id]/+page.server.ts` load function to fetch linked wigs via character_wigs join
- [ ] T104 [US3] In character detail page, replace "Linked Resources" empty state with actual data display

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Enhanced Outfit Tracking (Priority: P2) üîÆ **FUTURE**

**Status**: ‚è≠Ô∏è **DEFERRED** - P2 priority, implement after MVP validation

**Goal**: Outfits specify version/variation, track patterns, alteration notes, crafting tasks

**Dependencies**: ‚úÖ Phase 3 (Characters), existing outfit system

**Scope**: 
- Add `version` field to outfits (required if character linked per FR-104)
- Add pattern file uploads (PDF to R2)
- Add alteration notes (textarea)
- Add outfit tasks (similar to wig tasks)
- Link outfits to characters
- Update costume service to outfit service (rename)

**Estimated Tasks**: ~20 tasks, 6-8 hours

**Reason for Deferral**: Outfits already exist in the codebase (from spec 045/047). This story enhances existing functionality rather than creating net-new capability. Validate character + wig MVP first before enhancing outfits.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Consolidated Resource Management (Priority: P2) üîÆ **FUTURE**

**Status**: ‚è≠Ô∏è **DEFERRED** - P2 priority, developer-focused consolidation

**Dependencies**: ‚úÖ All previous phases

**Scope**:
- Data migration from accessories to wigs table
- Update all resource types to support optional character FK
- Consolidation documentation
- Deprecate old specs

**Estimated Tasks**: ~15 tasks, 4-6 hours

**Reason for Deferral**: This is cleanup/consolidation work. Complete MVP and validate with users before investing in migration.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

**Sequential Phases** (must complete in order):
1. Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí Phase 3: User Story 1 (MVP)
2. Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 4: User Story 2 (Wigs depend on Characters)
3. Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5: User Story 3 (Linking requires both Characters and Wigs)

**Parallel Opportunities Within Phases**:
- Phase 1: T003, T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel (different files)
- Phase 2: T009 (wigs table), T010 (junction), T012-T013 (RLS), T015 (types) can run parallel after T008 (characters table)
- Phase 2: T016 (character-service), T017 (wig-service), T018 (allocation-service) can run in parallel
- Phase 3: T019-T020 (overview page), T028-T034 (card component), T035-T043 (detail page), T050-T057 (photo upload) can start in parallel after T016
- Phase 4: T066-T072 (overview), T073-T079 (card), T080-T086 (detail) can start in parallel after T017
- Phase 5: T103-T110 (character linking), T111-T115 (completion %), T116-T118 (multi-char), T119-T121 (filtering) can run in parallel

## Risk Mitigation

**Risks**:
1. **Photo upload failures** (R2 integration): Mitigated by 3 retries + draft fallback (FR-051)
2. **Character completion calculation performance**: Mitigated by caching percentage in character table
3. **Concurrent edits**: Mitigated by last-write-wins with timestamp notification (FR-052)
4. **Scope creep from 180 FRs**: Mitigated by deferring P2 stories and future systems

**Dependencies on External Systems**:
- Cloudflare R2 (photo storage): Already in use, proven pattern
- Supabase PostgreSQL: Already in use, proven pattern
- JetBrains Mono font: Google Fonts CDN, fallback to system fonts

## Out of Scope (Deferred to Future Specs)

The following systems are defined in spec 048 but **explicitly deferred** to maintain solo developer efficiency:

**12-Resource Full System** (FR-054 to FR-148):
- Materials / Craft Supplies Management (FR-073 to FR-087)
- Tools Management (FR-088 to FR-102)
- Accessories Management (FR-103 to FR-115)
- Enhanced Props (FR-116 to FR-124)
- Enhanced Equipment (FR-125 to FR-130)
- Enhanced Crew (FR-131 to FR-134)
- Enhanced Locations (FR-135 to FR-140)
- Events / Convention Management (FR-054 to FR-060)
- Vendor / Shop Management (FR-061 to FR-067)
- Universal Receipt System (FR-143 to FR-145)
- Post-Event Care Reminders (FR-146 to FR-148)
- Weather API Integration (location warnings)
- Difficulty / Skill Assessment (FR-068 to FR-072)

**Rationale**: These systems represent Phase 1, 3, 4, 5 of the implementation plan. They add immense value but are NOT blocking for the character-centric model MVP. Ship character + wig + linking first, validate with users, then iterate.

## Total Task Summary

**Setup & Foundation**: 18 tasks (T001-T018) - ~3-5 hours  
**User Story 1 (MVP)**: 47 tasks (T019-T065) - ~6-8 hours  
**User Story 2 (Wigs)**: 37 tasks (T066-T102) - ~6-8 hours  
**User Story 3 (Linking)**: 19 tasks (T103-T121) - ~4-6 hours  
**Polish**: 11 tasks (T122-T132) - ~2-3 hours

**Total MVP (Phases 1-5)**: 132 tasks, ~21-30 hours  
**Deferred (Phases 6-7)**: ~35 tasks, ~10-14 hours (implement after validation)

**MVP Delivery Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for solo developer with existing codebase patterns

## Notes

- **Stress-Reducing Design**: All UI tasks reference ui-design.md for calm, clean, spacious design (generous whitespace, gentle animations, no confetti/sound effects)
- **Theme Integration**: All components use CSS custom properties (`var(--theme-*)`) per theme-integration-guide.md
- **JetBrains Mono**: Headings use monospace font for technical precision aesthetic
- **Logo Green**: Primary color #19DA5A, accent #21F96A, dark #008F31 throughout
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase delivers independent value, can ship to production
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Phased approach maintains VIII.5 Solo Developer Efficiency by avoiding 180-FR waterfall
