# Characters & Costumes Management

## Overview

Comprehensive management system for character profiles and costume inventory, including templates, patterns, and construction resources for cosplay projects.

## User Stories

### User Story 1 - Character Profile Management (Priority: P1)

Cosplayers need to create and manage detailed character profiles with costume history, series information, and photo galleries.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all costume management; essential for organizing cosplay projects and tracking character-specific resources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a character profile, adding costume items, and verifying all data persists correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add a new character, **When** they create a character profile, **Then** they can enter name, series, cosplayer assignment, and external character ID
2. **Given** a character profile exists, **When** viewing the character, **Then** all associated costumes, props, and shoots are displayed
3. **Given** a character has multiple costumes, **When** viewing the character profile, **Then** costumes are organized by status and shoot history

### User Story 2 - Costume Inventory Management (Priority: P1)

Users need to track individual costume items through their complete lifecycle from planning to completion or disposal.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality for managing costume resources; enables proper inventory tracking and cost management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating costume items, updating their status, and verifying state transitions work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add a costume item, **When** they create it, **Then** they can specify type (costume, prop, accessory, makeup), character association, and initial status
2. **Given** a costume item exists, **When** updating its status, **Then** the state transition follows the defined lifecycle rules
3. **Given** a costume item is sold or damaged, **When** updating status, **Then** required financial or damage details must be provided

### User Story 3 - Templates and Patterns Management (Priority: P2)

Cosplayers need to store and organize sewing patterns, templates, and construction references for their costumes.

**Why this priority**: Essential for DIY costume construction; helps organize construction resources and share patterns within teams.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading pattern files, organizing them by costume, and verifying they're accessible when needed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has sewing patterns, **When** they upload them to a costume, **Then** patterns are organized by costume and accessible during construction
2. **Given** patterns exist for a costume, **When** viewing the costume details, **Then** all associated patterns and templates are displayed
3. **Given** a user wants to share patterns, **When** they mark patterns as shareable, **Then** team members can access and download them

### User Story 4 - Costume Construction Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users need to track construction progress, materials used, and construction notes for their costumes.

**Why this priority**: Helps manage complex construction projects; enables better planning and resource allocation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding construction notes, updating progress, and verifying the information is properly organized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is constructing a costume, **When** they add construction notes, **Then** notes are timestamped and associated with the costume
2. **Given** construction is in progress, **When** updating progress, **Then** the costume status reflects current construction state
3. **Given** materials are used, **When** recording material usage, **Then** costs are tracked and associated with the costume
