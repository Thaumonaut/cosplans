# Feature Specification: File & Asset Management

**Feature Branch**: `033-file-asset-management`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Centralized file and asset storage, versioning, and management for all app-generated and user-uploaded files

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Upload and Store Files (Priority: P1)

Users need to upload various files (photos, documents, references) and have them stored securely with clear organization and access control.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality for cosplay app; files are central to shoots, costumes, references, and portfolio management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading files, verifying they're stored, and confirming they can be retrieved by authorized users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is uploading a reference image, **When** they select file(s), **Then** system accepts common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP) up to 20MB each
2. **Given** files are uploaded, **When** upload completes, **Then** user can immediately access and use the file in the app
3. **Given** multiple files are selected, **When** user uploads, **Then** system handles batch upload with progress indication for each file
4. **Given** upload is interrupted, **When** connection resumes, **Then** upload resumes from last checkpoint without re-uploading completed portions

### User Story 2 - Organize Files and Assets (Priority: P2)

Users need to organize files into logical collections (albums, folders, projects) and tag them for easy discovery.

**Why this priority**: Prevents users from getting lost in large file collections; improves discoverability and project organization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating folders/albums, organizing files, adding tags, and verifying search finds files by tags.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has multiple files, **When** they create a folder/album structure, **Then** files can be moved into folders and remain organized
2. **Given** files are tagged, **When** user searches by tag, **Then** only matching files are returned
3. **Given** a folder has files, **When** user applies bulk operations (tag, move, share), **Then** all files in folder are affected together

---

### User Story 3 - Version Control and History (Priority: P2)

Users need to maintain version history of files (especially documents like release forms, shot plans) so they can track changes and restore previous versions.

**Why this priority**: Critical for compliance (legal documents), project auditing, and recovering from accidental overwrites.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading file, uploading new version, viewing version history, and restoring previous version.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user uploads a new version of a file, **When** system stores it, **Then** previous version is retained and accessible in version history
2. **Given** file has multiple versions, **When** user views version history, **Then** each version shows upload date, uploader, and file size
3. **Given** an old version exists, **When** user restores it, **Then** it becomes current version and new version is created in history

---

### User Story 4 - Share and Control Access (Priority: P1)

Users need to share files with team members and control permissions (view-only, edit, delete) to manage sensitive information properly.

**Why this priority**: Critical for team collaboration and protecting sensitive information (model releases, budget documents).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sharing file with specific team members, verifying they can access it, and confirming permission restrictions work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to share a file, **When** they set permissions (view-only, can comment, can download), **Then** recipients can only perform allowed actions
2. **Given** a file is shared, **When** permissions are changed, **Then** changes apply immediately to all current and future access attempts
3. **Given** a shared file is deleted by owner, **When** others try to access it, **Then** they see "file deleted by owner" message but can still see history

---

### User Story 5 - Manage Storage and Quotas (Priority: P2)

Users need to understand their storage usage and have clear policies about storage limits and retention.

**Why this priority**: Helps users manage storage costs and prevents runaway storage usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading files, checking storage dashboard, and verifying quota enforcement and warnings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has uploaded files, **When** they view storage dashboard, **Then** they see total storage used, quota limit, and breakdown by file type
2. **Given** user is approaching quota, **When** they upload files, **Then** warning appears indicating remaining storage
3. **Given** user exceeds quota, **When** they attempt to upload, **Then** upload is blocked and clear messaging explains quota overages

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user exceeds storage quota? (Upload blocked, user can delete old files or upgrade)
- How are files handled when user account is deleted? (Files are deleted after retention period or transferred to account owner if team context)
- What if virus scan fails during upload? (File is quarantined and user is notified)
- How are duplicate files detected and handled? (Warn user but allow duplicates unless explicitly prevented)
- What if a file becomes corrupted? (System detects on access and offers previous version or re-upload)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support upload of files up to 100MB each, with total account storage quota (team-managed)
- **FR-002**: System MUST support common file formats: images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP), documents (PDF, DOCX), and video (MP4, MOV)
- **FR-003**: System MUST organize files into folders/albums with unlimited nesting depth
- **FR-004**: System MUST support tagging files with multiple tags for categorization
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain complete version history for each file with timestamps and uploader information
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow restoration of any previous file version with one click
- **FR-007**: System MUST support file sharing with granular permissions (view-only, can download, can comment, can edit, can delete)
- **FR-008**: System MUST send notifications when files are shared with a user
- **FR-009**: System MUST display real-time storage usage and remaining quota in user dashboard
- **FR-010**: System MUST warn users at 80% and 100% storage quota utilization
- **FR-011**: System MUST block uploads when quota is exceeded with clear messaging
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide file search across all owned and shared files by name, tag, or metadata
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate file thumbnails for images and previews for documents
- **FR-014**: System MUST support batch operations: tag, move, share, and delete multiple files

- **FR-017**: System MUST virus scan all uploaded files before making available to users
- **FR-018**: System MUST deduplicate identical files at storage level (identical files reference same storage)

### Key Entities

- **File**: Represents a stored file with name, type, size, upload date, and owner
- **FileVersion**: Historical versions of files with version number, upload date, and uploader
- **FileShare**: Record of file sharing with user/team, permissions, and expiration date
- **Folder/Album**: Organizational container for files with nesting and visibility settings
- **StorageQuota**: Track storage usage per user/team with limits and current utilization
