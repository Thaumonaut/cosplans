# Feature Specification: Characters & Costumes Management

**Feature Branch**: `049-characters-costumes`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Character and costume management for cosplay planning, including character profiles, costume pieces, templates, and patterns.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Character Profiles (Priority: P1)

As a cosplayer, I want to create detailed character profiles so that I can plan and track my cosplay projects systematically.

**Why this priority**: Core character management functionality - essential for organized cosplay planning.

**Independent Test**: User can create character profiles with photos, details, and series information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm on the characters page, **When** I click "Add Character" and enter "Aragorn" from "Lord of the Rings", **Then** character profile is created with basic details
2. **Given** I'm adding a character, **When** I upload reference photos and add description "Ranger from the North", **Then** character has visual references and context
3. **Given** I'm adding a character, **When** I set complexity to "High" and add notes "Focus on weathered look", **Then** character shows difficulty level and specific requirements
4. **Given** I'm on mobile, **When** I add a character, **Then** form is mobile-optimized and photo upload works smoothly

### User Story 2 - Manage Costume Pieces (Priority: P2)

As a costume builder, I want to break down characters into individual costume pieces so that I can plan construction systematically and track progress.

**Why this priority**: Costume planning and construction tracking - essential for organized costume building.

**Independent Test**: User can create costume pieces, assign them to characters, and track construction progress.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm planning a character, **When** I add costume pieces "Tunic", "Pants", "Boots", "Cloak", **Then** each piece is created and linked to the character
2. **Given** I'm working on a piece, **When** I update status to "In Progress" and add notes "Cutting fabric", **Then** piece shows current status and progress
3. **Given** I'm viewing a character, **When** I check costume pieces, **Then** I see all pieces with their current status and progress
4. **Given** I'm planning construction, **When** I view piece details, **Then** I see materials needed and construction notes

---

### User Story 3 - Store Templates and Patterns (Priority: P3)

As a costume maker, I want to store sewing patterns, templates, and construction guides so that I can reuse them for similar projects and share with team members.

**Why this priority**: Pattern and template management - essential for efficient costume construction and knowledge sharing.

**Independent Test**: User can upload patterns, create templates, and organize them by type and character.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm adding a pattern, **When** I upload a PDF pattern file and tag it as "Tunic Pattern", **Then** pattern is stored and searchable
2. **Given** I'm creating a template, **When** I save "Basic Tunic Template" with construction notes, **Then** template is available for reuse
3. **Given** I'm planning a new character, **When** I search for "tunic patterns", **Then** I see all relevant patterns and templates
4. **Given** I'm sharing with team, **When** I mark a pattern as "Team Shared", **Then** other team members can access it

---

### User Story 4 - Track Costume Progress and History (Priority: P4)

As a project manager, I want to track costume construction progress and maintain a history of completed projects so that I can learn from past work and plan future projects.

**Why this priority**: Progress tracking and project history - helps with learning and future planning.

**Independent Test**: User can track progress, view history, and analyze construction patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm working on a costume, **When** I update piece progress to "Completed", **Then** overall character progress updates automatically
2. **Given** I'm viewing a character, **When** I check progress history, **Then** I see timeline of construction milestones
3. **Given** I'm planning a new character, **When** I view similar completed characters, **Then** I can learn from past construction techniques
4. **Given** I'm analyzing my work, **When** I view construction statistics, **Then** I see average construction times and success rates

- What if a costume piece needs to be modified for different body types? (Support for size adjustments and customization)
- How to handle characters that are from ongoing series with new designs? (Support for character updates and version control)
- What if a costume piece is shared between multiple characters? (Support for shared pieces and conflict detection)
- How to handle characters that require historical accuracy or cultural sensitivity? (Support for research notes and cultural guidelines)
- What if a costume piece needs to be adapted for different events? (Support for event-specific modifications)
- How to handle characters that are original designs or fan interpretations? (Support for original character creation and fan art)
