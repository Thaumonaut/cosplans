# UI Improvements for Resource Pages

## Current Status
✅ Database migrations complete
✅ All 5 resource pages functional (Costumes, Crew, Equipment, Props, Locations)
✅ Basic CRUD operations working
⚠️ UI needs improvement based on placeholder page design

## What Makes the Placeholder Page Better

### 1. **Stats Dashboard** (Top of page)
- 4 stat cards showing:
  - Total Costumes
  - Unique Characters
  - Excellent Condition count
  - Storage Locations count
- Each with icon and large number
- Uses ThemedCard component

### 2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**
- Uses ThemedCard for sections
- Clear separation between filters and content
- Consistent spacing

### 3. **More Information in Cards**
- Shows: Type, Condition, Location, Last Worn
- Better use of space
- Key-value pairs for details

### 4. **Better Empty State**
- Icon + helpful message
- Explains what the page is for
- Clear CTA button

### 5. **Info Box**
- Bottom section explaining the feature
- Helps new users understand purpose
