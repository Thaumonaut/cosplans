## ✨ What Makes This Plan Unique

### 1. **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**
Not just "build authentication" but:
- Google OAuth: user clicks button → redirected → JWT created ✅
- Passkeys: email signup → confirmation → passkey setup → login ✅
- 2FA: setup → QR code → verify → backup codes ✅

### 2. **Constitution-Aligned**
Every feature checked against 10 core principles. No "tech for tech's sake."

### 3. **70% Test Coverage Built-In**
Not tacked on at end. Testing integrated into daily tasks.

### 4. **Performance Targets**
- <3s page load (LTE/4G)
- <500ms API response (p95)
- WebP + lazy loading for images

### 5. **Week-by-Week Breakdown**
Not "Weeks 1-12 are murky", but:
- Day 1-2: Setup & DB
- Day 3-4: API endpoints
- Day 5-6: Remaining CRUD
- Day 7-8: Testing
- Day 9-10: Docs & PR
